elsewhere, you can do `text = gpt2.generate(sess, return_as_list=True)[0]`\n","\n","You can also pass in a `prefix` to the generate function to force the text to start with a given character sequence and generate text from there (good if you add an indicator when the text starts).\n","\n","You can also generate multiple texts at a time by specifing `nsamples`. Unique to GPT-2, you can pass a `batch_size` to generate multiple samples in parallel, giving a massive speedup (in Colaboratory, set a maximum of 20 for `batch_size`).\n","\n","Other optional-but-helpful parameters for `gpt2.generate` and friends:\n","\n","*  **`length`**: Number of tokens to generate (default 1023, the maximum)\n","* **`temperature`**: The higher the temperature, the crazier the text (default 0.7, recommended to keep between 0.7 and 1.0)\n","* **`top_k`**: Limits the generated guesses to the top *k* guesses (default 0 which disables the behavior; if the generated output is super crazy, you may want to set `top_k=40`)\n","* **`top_p`**: Nucleus sampling: limits the generated guesses to a cumulative probability. (gets good results on a dataset with `top_p=0.9`)\n","* **`truncate`**: Truncates the input text until a given sequence, excluding that sequence (e.g. if `truncate='<|endoftext|>'`, the returned text will include everything before the first `<|endoftext|>`). It may be useful to combine this with a smaller `length` if the input texts are short.\n","*  **`include_prefix`**: If using `truncate` and `include_prefix=False`, the specified `prefix` will not be included in the returned text."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"8DKMc0fiej4N","colab_type":"code","outputId":"e1de84d4-0763-4117-d63a-b4670a9b8cd3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1566857171604,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":6684,"user":{"displayName":"Tomas Fox","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mC88eAGR-wtGA1mFcCb0wkMrxW6b-dewso0PIbWtw=s64","userId":"10373093799572282102"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000}},"source":["gpt2.generate(sess,\n","              run_name='120k_short_desc.txt',\n","              length=200,\n","              temperature=0.9,\n","              prefix=False,\n","              nsamples=10,\n","              batch_size=10\n","              )"],"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["63-72276,LieTour is a french bike sharing startup competing with other ride sharing companies.\n","63-72277,A Finnish startup focusing on online B2C education that opens the door for schools to adopt the B2C system.\n","63-72278,Lingan is a social crowdfunding platform for indie developers.\n","63-72279,\"Liven helps you pay bills by adding friction to switching phone numbers - simple, fast and secure.\"\n","63-72280,\"Lintight provides an intelligent cloud-based solution for application developers, with a focus on small businesses.\"\n","63-72281,Lovechain was conceived in the year 2000 as a new way to unite buyers and sellers.\n","63-72282,Led by principles of TIB tender, we develop a unique web platform to make the operation of the secondary trading market in un-indoctrinated markets.\n","63-72283,\"Learn a new\n","====================\n","agl.io provides a new approach to building Agile communication.\n","45417,\"Host your party.
