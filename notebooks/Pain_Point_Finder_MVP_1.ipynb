In a case that has become a symbol of road safety, eight-year-old Austin boy Warren was driving home from school one day when he saw a construction crew working on the side of the road. Thinking it was a strange sight, Warren swerved to avoid the construction vehicle and drove home worried. Fortunately, the construction worker's life was spared because he was sitting in the car after all. After an extensive investigation, the Austin Fire Department discovered that the construction worker's name is Warren and he was driving home with his family on the day the accident occurred. Officer Warren is survived by his father, Gregg, and his mother, Jan.A. Gregg. Officer Warren was born and raised in Austin, Texas and graduated from Austin Southern College in 2011.

Our cancer research is based on science and we share the vision that understanding the causes of breast cancer can help women take steps to reduce their risk, and ultimately reduce their burden of the disease. Our cancer genetic research centers combine science with cutting-edge clinical genomic testing to discover and validate important information about a risk factor for the disease we all carry. Our mission is to identify and prevent the cancer we all carry, and to make that risk visible to both women and men so they can make better health decisions.<|endoftext|>\n",
