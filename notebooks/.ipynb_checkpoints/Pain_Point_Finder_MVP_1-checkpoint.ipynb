    "# MVP 1: Generation of Novel Company Descriptions for Use in Project Ideation\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of MVP 1 is to generate novel company descriptions and output those ideas to a JSON format. To do this we had to pass through three major steps:\n",
    "1. Source a large volume of company descriptions\n",
    "2. Create and train a model to generate company descriptions\n",
    "3. Apply postprocessing to boost the signal to noise ratio in the generated descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Success for MVP 1 hinges on three key measures:\n",
    "1. \\>70% of generated ideas are readable/comprehensible problems\n",
    "2. Reduction in time spent by Lambda Labs staff sourcing basic project ideas - stakeholder judges there to be significant value from the output\n",
    "3. Output is formatted in JSON format in preparation for MVP 2\n"

    "We used company descriptions because they set out their goals, identify issues, include semi-specific plans, and utilize emerging technologies. We feel that these are all things which Lambda Labs may want in a project for their students to show off to the world, and a good dataset for our model to emulate.\n",

    "#Why GPT-2?\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-2 is a LM ([language model](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/13188/whats-an-lstm-lm-formulation)) which has had a massive amount of pre-training done to it in the form of every reddit post ever being fed through it.  From this it has learnt the structure of language, and how certain words relate to each other.  This becomes an extraordinarily powerful generating tool that can take an input and 'predict' the next words using probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful to our task, as we wish to provide generated ideas for labs that represent a high probability of being an issue people have.  This model will take in the data, learn the structure of the 'primer' (structured) data, and begin using that as basis to create its text.  Our primer data needs to represent problems in some semi-structured way, which is why we use the Crunchbase company descriptions."

    "\n",
    "- __`accumulate gradients`__: decides how strong backpropagation will be by how many gradients to sum at a time(similar to max_depth in RF, default of 7, keep below 15)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`steps`**: (epochs) This is the main parameter, and controls how many times should we pass our data back and forth through the machine (as much as your time will allow, diminishing returns past certain point)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`run_name`**: designates the name of the checkpoint(zip file) that we can pull the model back out of if needed.  Saved in this will be the models exact state at the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`only_train_transformer_layer`**: determines whether or not to do the full train(on structured/limited data) or a lighter train(for things like unstructured comments/text or large bulk data)\n",

Thinking it was a strange sight, Warren swerved to avoid the construction vehicle and drove home worried. Fortunately, the construction worker's life was spared because he was sitting in the car after all. After an extensive investigation, the Austin Fire Department discovered that the construction worker's name is Warren and he was driving home with his family on the day the accident occurred. Officer Warren is survived by his father, Gregg, and his mother, Jan.A. Gregg. Officer Warren was born and raised in Austin, Texas and graduated from Austin Southern College in 2011.
