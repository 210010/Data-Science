So, citizens use the application to register risks and the NGO to deliver it to the people in charge of the solution. After that we asked ourselves ""What happens in organizations?"" And we saw a huge opportunity because there are many accidents in the work environment.  Here in Chile, there were more than 170,000 (one hundred seventy thousand) accidents in organizations last year. Moreover, we saw that the risk detection processes are manual (using paper), which results in decentralized information, useless for decision making. That is why we opened our platform for the organizations. so they can use our mobile application to search and register risks in their buildings using images and georeferentiation. Then, at the office, they can complete those registries, create reports and send them to the people in charge of the solution. But that is not enough, we are continually innovating; adding new features every month like guidelines to avoid the human errors or automatically risk detection through video cameras. So, why Ubicuo? Because we reduce four times the time needed to detect and solve risks and that, is translated as less workIng accIdents;… and also we centralize the information and provide statistics. How to acquire Ubicuo? It’s easy, by subscribing to one of our packages or asking for a quotation. Currently we have four paying clients, three hundred users, one hundred inspectors and more than five thousand risks detected.  We have to say thanks to StartUp Chile, because since the beginning of the program we have been duplicated our billing, we got a pilot in Santiago and we are closing a deal to get private investment.  Finally, the team. We have complementary profiles, specialists in different software areas and project management. but we have one thing in common: we love challenges.
