Ulysses Systems,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ulysses-systems,"Computer, Software",A software company specializing in the delivery of actionable information.,"Ulysses is a growing global software company that evolved from its Shipping Industry roots into a different kind of knowledge management software supplier. Ulysses defines knowledge as “actionable information” that is available to the person with the responsibility to act, at a time and place where the knowledge influences actions. Their 3rd generation Task Assistant software uses patent pending technology resulting from thirteen years of research and practical experience servicing the shipping industry, to deliver access to “actionable information” where and when the knowledge positively impacts operational outcomes. Task Assistant’s ability to efficiently and consistently provide knowledge access, unprompted, makes it the best software platform currently available for developing, enhancing and deploying Computer Assisted Decision Making Systems. Granted that inadequate bureaucratic processes either hide or fail to distribute information to the right people quickly enough, bureaucracies, designed to efficiently handle large volumes of normal and known transactions can experience critical delays in their response to transactions or events outside the norms. Integrating Task Assistant with existing Business Process Management Systems, enterprises can expect task execution and event response where awareness alerts are triggered and applicable relevant information is delivered unprompted. Task Assistant integrated with content management repositories increases the value of the repository by facilitating improved utilization of the content.  Alerts and alarms issued by Business Intelligence-based monitoring systems or by Text Analytics-enabled listening systems can easily be integrated with Task Assistant, accelerating and improving event response. With Task Assistant, users no longer need to know that knowledge might exist or where it might be to use it, because it will find them when they need it. Task Assistant’s ability to capture, recognize and deliver knowledge, results from capabilities that use a Role/Task/Context process model to derive indices that link information objects to each usage and comprehensively tracks usage back to the objects. In Business Process Management Solutions the return on investment is diminished if the process execution experience isn’t captured and recycled to continuously improve the process. Similarly, the return on investment from the most complete Enterprise Content Management System is limited if information it contains relevant to task execution or event response isn’t used. And investments in Business Intelligence and Text Analytics, designed to facilitate identification of opportunities that maximize organizational performance, fail if the findings cannot be acted upon or events responded to promptly. As a knowledge management tool Task Assistant can considerably optimize the return on investment as the in-built model favours comprehensive data capture, intuitive access and utilization of information."
