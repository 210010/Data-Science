Optimus Technologies,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/optimus-technologies,"Manufacturing, Renewable Energy, Transportation, Waste Management",Optimus Technologies is the market leader in EPA compliant biodiesel conversion systems for medium- and heavy-duty trucks.,"Optimus Technologies® designs and builds patented EPA compliant biodiesel conversion systems (“Vector Systems”) with integrated telematics to allow medium and heavy-duty trucks to operate on up to 100% biodiesel in temperatures to -20°F.  Our system is deployable within 30 days providing North American trucking fleets with the lowest cost, highest return, barrier free alternative fuel system available, allowing them a significant return on investment while achieving sustainability targets.  By partnering with major industry players to leverage their capabilities, Optimus will deliver a fully integrated client solution that is rapidly scalable, creating a $279MM company by 2023. MARKET OPPORTUNITY In the U.S. there are over 10.8 million medium- and heavy-duty on-road commercial vehicles that consume 39 billion gallons of diesel fuel annually and account for 23% of transportation sector greenhouse gas emissions. ,   In Canada, these figures are 1.1 million, 13 billion, and 70% respectively.  Fuel costs are the second largest operating expense of a fleet, after labor, accounting for roughly 40% of all costs.   Fleets are aggressively seeking solutions to reduce fuel costs, even fractions of a percent, because the bottom-line impact is so substantial. Optimus enables fleets to reduce fuel costs by at least 10%, utilize domestically produced fuel and reduce greenhouse gas emissions while allowing a fleet of 100 trucks to save at least $800,000 in annual fuel costs. Of these 11.9 million trucks, approximately 3 million are currently operating on a low biodiesel blend .  This early customer segment represents a beachhead market opportunity of $30 billion.   WHY INVEST COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES:  We are the most competitive alternative fuel system available.  Directly competing technologies such as CNG, and the emerging segment of electric trucks have high barriers to entry including long lead times, high technology and infrastructure costs, and limitations on long-haul adaptability. Our infrastructure costs are at most, 10% of competing technologies.  Our integrated solution is rapidly scalable, integrating seamlessly with existing equipment and infrastructure and our range equates to and can exceed diesel technology.  Competitive advantage increases in relation to weight class, with Optimus easily bypassing all heavy-duty competitors.   *  Only Fully Integrate Alternative Fuel Solution:  Fuel System, Fuel, Fueling Infrastructure *  Lowest Cost Alternative Fuel System:  $12,000 Fully Installed *  Guaranteed  Annual Cost Savings - $8,000/year/truck *  Rapidly Deployable: 30 days *  Achieves Sustainability Targets:  GHG Emission Credit: 60-100%, Particulate Matter Reduction 40% *  DPF Operating System Improvement - Improves Efficiency *  Fuel Infrastructure Solved *  Simple Maintenance - Fully Automated  *  Available for New and Used Vehicles PROVEN MANAGEMENT TEAM - Extensive experience across the transportation, renewable fuels, software and engineering sectors from start-up to leading industry players.  Multiple successes founding, financing, scaling, managing, and exiting companies. PATENTED, PROVEN TECHNOLOGY - 4 patents (2 approved and 2 pending) and extensive IP surrounding proprietary engine systems’ control software. We believe our system to be the only EPA compliant biodiesel conversion system available for medium- and heavy-duty trucks.  The Vector System is a proven technology in early stages of commercialization, backed by five years of research and seven years of pilot testing and development.  LEVERAGE SUSTAINABILITY & REGULATION – There is a large and growing demand for alternatives to gasoline and diesel that is driven by regulation as well as public and private sector interest in reducing carbon and NOx emissions.  The Company’s profitability and customer value proposition is not dependent upon these incentives, but we will leverage these multiple state, provincial, US and Canadian policies to further support expansion.   Optimus’ system has been approved for the Government of Quebec’s Programme Ecocamionnage, providing a 30% rebate on the installed cost of the system.  Similar provincial incentives will be pursued across Canada. ONLY APPROVED PATHWAY FOR HIGH BIODIESEL BLENDS UP TO B100 IN CALIFORNIA – Leveraging our RFID system to meet California fuel control requirements, Optimus’ core technology combined with our RFID fuel management system will provide our investors, distributors, and fuel partners a 2-3 year first mover advantage in California. SUPPORT AMERICAN MANUFACTURING & JOB CREATION – Optimus will directly create over 200 new jobs and 100% of our components are sourced from US manufacturers and suppliers. INVESTOR VALUE CREATION – $199-$279MM valuation by 2023 (5-7x EBITDA), on $12.8MM total invested capital, yielding 16-22x total investment. "

Today, the leading brain-computer interface (BCI) companies distribute fixed devices with limited or closed access to the algorithms that translate raw EEG signals to meaningful data. These devices are powerful and effective for application development but not ideal for R&D requiring adjustable hardware setups and direct control over the signal processing techniques. OpenBCI is fully accessible and powered by an open-source community of hardware and software builders, making it easy for creators of any skill level and ideal for researchers who haven’t yet settled on the perfect system design.

It’s specifically designed for collaboration and content curation in flipped or online learning environments.   Open Assembly is tackling a big gap in education technology: the absence of truly permeable open courseware. Existing courseware offerings (open and proprietary) are not designed for collaborative learning and instruction, and they’re difficult for students and educators to reuse or adapt to local needs. Nor do they accommodate today’s participatory culture. Open Assembly allows instructors to customize or adapt digital curricula, collaborate with colleagues or peers, and personalize instruction. It helps students become creators, not consumers, of learning content, encourages responsible content sharing and curation, and facilitates the development of collaborative skills.  By leveraging the inherent shareability of open educational resources (OER), Open Assembly engages instructors and students in the production, transmission, and broadcasting of knowledge--co-teaching, co-learning, co-researching. OER make this truly possible, at little or no cost.  Open Assembly complements existing OER products, services, and initiatives such as MIT OpenCourseWare, OpenStax College, Lumen Learning, MERLOT, Connexions, and others—with a toolkit that combines functionalities that have not been integrated into a single product, until now: --easily reuse, adapt, and revise open courseware (e.g. MIT OCW) as modular course templates; --assemble learning playlists with unbundled, chapter-level content from peer-reviewed open textbooks and proprietary content;  --curate additional content, including rich media, from within a course or project;  --share content with anyone else, inside or outside of a given course or project; --engagement analytics. Open Assembly gives every educator the opportunity to be a learner, and every learner the opportunity to become an educator. Users are not required to identify themselves as instructors or students: it is just as likely that a user could be administering a course as participating in one."

Collecting data from edge devices and pushing it to the cloud is dependent on the one thing that connects it all: the network. If the network is not working properly, it undermines the data’s integrity. Optigo is dedicated to creating healthy networks for smart buildings. We make sure the data moves seamlessly from edge-to-cloud or edge-to-server, uncompromised and on time.  We simplify the complex for people who own, manage, and operate smart buildings.

But businesses care about traffic and sales, not fans and followers, and it is really challenging to tie all this activity back to these desired actions. With your own content there is limited capacity to self-promote and when you’re sharing all that third party content you’re just sending traffic away to other people’s sites – so businesses and their marketers are left fuelling newsfeeds and engaging fans with little or no payback. Openr changes all that. Now, you can add your own promotional message and a direct call-to-action onto every page you share. So with Openr, you can drive action from the content you share – be it traffic, email subscriptions, polls, even payments.  By closing the gap between content sharing and direct action Openr has already been named a Must-Have Marketing Tool for 2015 by Entrepreneur Magazine and is being used by global brands and agency giants."

Around the same time the EMR team at Partners In Health led by Hamish Fraser and Darius Jazayeri were looking at ways to scale up the PIH-EMR web-based medical record system developed to manage drug resistant tuberculosis in Peru, and HIV in rural Haiti. Paul, Burke and Hamish met in September 2004 at the Medinfo conference in San Francisco, and recognized they had a common approach to medical information systems and a similar philosophy for healthcare and development and OpenMRS was born. Later, Chris Seebregts of the South African Medical Research Council (MRC) became the fourth founding member. OpenMRS is founded on the principles of openness and sharing of ideas, software and strategies for deployment and use. The system is designed to be usable in very resource poor environments and can be modified with the addition of new data items, forms and reports without programming.
