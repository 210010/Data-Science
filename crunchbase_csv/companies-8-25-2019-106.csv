Unequal Technologies,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/unequal-technologies-company,"Health Care, Manufacturing, Sporting Goods, Sports",Unequal Technologies was founded under the premise of reducing pain and injury in the human body through military-grade technologies.,"Unequal Technologies was founded by Robert Vito when he was an adjunct professor in the Penn State Graduate Business Program. Teaching coursework on entrepreneurship and accounting to up-and-coming business professionals, Rob was challenged by a student who wondered whether bulletproof armor could be made lighter and more flexible. After many years of research and over $10 million dollars in funding, the answer is UNEQUAL, a revolutionary composite that promises to reduce the pain and injury associated with impacts. The multilayer product was originally developed for military applications, and was tested under incredibly stringent guidelines issued by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), the organization that certifies bullet-resistant armor. UNEQUAL’s unique composite material, fortified with DuPont Kevlar® aramid fibers, works by stopping bullets and dispersing the impact energy of projectiles, helping the wearer to remain safe. The shock-blocking technology served to protect the wearer from impact injuries and bullet wounds sustained on the battlefield, and was adopted by soldiers, law enforcement personnel, and government agents. The technology behind these innovative products is backed by over 85 U.S. and international patents and extensive testing from independent, accredited laboratories the world over. OEM facilities and university science programs have verified the effectiveness of the shock-absorbing protective gear. The product was soon applied to the task of protecting those involved in professional sports. It first found favor in pro sports among NFL players, who flocked to the company’s protective wear. Now, the protective products can be found in body armor and helmet padding among dozens of players in the football league, and other sports governing bodies like the NHL and Major League Baseball have begun to use the products to help protect players. For action sports like the X Games, the lightweight protective products are ideal in that they protect against injuries while remaining flexible and easy to wear, even in extreme conditions. The protective head and body gear is vastly superior to other protective products on the market, especially those constructed of plastic and foam. The layered composite material in UNEQUAL’s protective product line is tough and resilient, able to withstand the abuse that collision and action sports can create. Collegiate and youth athletes in disciplines like baseball, lacrosse, soccer, hockey, and football can benefit from the protection UNEQUAL’s products provide. Products are designed to be affordable and can be customized for specific sporting applications and body types, giving the athlete tremendous flexibility while warding off the injuries and pain associated with sports impacts. UNEQUAL and its products have received several prominent awards for innovation in the field of protective sportswear. The company was recognized by Forbes as one of the magazine’s 100 Most Promising Companies. Thanks to our work with DuPont, the manufacturing company presented UNEQUAL with its Kevlar® Innovation Award in 2012. In 2013, Esquire, ESPN, and Inc. Magazine all listed the company and its products among the most important tech innovations for the year. The industry publication Composites Manufacturing called the company “The Industry’s Best” that same year, showcasing the protective gear’s growth from military origins to sporting applications and its future in protecting actors in movie and television productions, among many other roles."

UNICEF advocates for measures to give children the best start in life, because proper care at the youngest age forms the strongest foundation for a person’s future. UNICEF promotes girls’ education – ensuring that they complete primary education as a minimum – because it benefits all children, both girls and boys. Girls who are educated grow up to become better thinkers, better citizens, and better parents to their own children.  UNICEF acts so that all children are immunized against common childhood diseases, and are well nourished, because it is wrong for a child to suffer or die from a preventable illness.

uniporter,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/uniporter,"Mobile Apps, Ride Sharing, Smart Cities, Transportation",unifying smart transportation,"The objective of uniporter to create a smart transportation calendar which automatically arranges the optimal transportation method after the user inputs his transportation requirements into our calendar. Our end-user simply input their transportation preferences; we optimize the rest. The uniporter platform is composed of four layers: smart calendar, optimize, automate, transportation ecosystem. In our smart calendar, the user inputs transportation events such as his daily round trip to his company or his upcoming flight. Our system recommends users to add new transportation events into their calendar based on patterns we find in their transits. Knowing our users’ departure point, destination, time, and requirements of their transportation is the basis of our optimization. We optimize the user's trip and minimize pricing by considering a variety of factors. We try to assign the optimal mobility mode. If the user is willing to leave early, has a trip less than 3km away, and it is not raining, we might book the user a scooter or a bike. To lower cost, we look for other compatible booked uber rides to form rideshares, so the user can experience a two-way split discount instead of UberPool’s 25% discount. We scan for the lowest pricing in the transportation ecosystem and cover options the user may not know. We cover additional requirements in certain scenarios such as luggage capacity for trips to the airport. And we also allow the user to set preferences such as on-time, cheapest, or luxury. We call the ride for the user automatically by checking how long it takes for the selected ride option to arrive and notify the user when their ride is almost here. This way, the user doesn't experience wait time. We integrate the entire transportation ecosystem, including micro-mobility services to ensure the user gets the full benefit of what's out there, including specialized options that just happen to work for their requirement. Right now in its early stages, uniporter is branded as a free web/mobile app that uses an optimization algorithm to arrange rideshare groups among students who commute between their local airport and university campus during peak travel seasons. Our objective is to replace the manual, ineffective process of searching for rideshare peers on student-organized Facebook groups present on almost all university campuses with a streamlined service that help students discover highly-compatible peers with a few clicks."

Due to the inherent conservative nature of large corporate companies, they do not extend themselves to take supply side risk.  On the other hand the miners being new do not have the banking support to collateralize on payment instruments when they sign contracts with steel mills. This leave many miners seeking high and low for bridge funding (purchase order funding) to service contracts. As they understand the risk and management of these deals, they are in a unique position to profit from these transactions  provided they can provide the purchase order funding. By supporting the miner they can offer a full service deal structure for the end buyers, similar to then they buy from large mining companies.  This involves their company taking the Letter of Credit from the end buyer and processing it, to extend an LC to the miner, an LC to the shipping company and then control all payments based on delivery of tested and cleared minerals to a free trade zone where they can take title to the product in smaller volumes while paying the miner based on smaller volumes delivered. This provides oxygen to the miner and allow them to work with us to manage the delivery of large contractual volumes that they otherwise would not be able to service. Once they have 90% of the minerals under their name they call the vessel which implies a 20% mobilization fee. Once the vessel is loaded, they can claim the buyers full LC.
