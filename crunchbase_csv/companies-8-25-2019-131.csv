More than half of STEM students don't achieve their STEM degrees, and many students are tripped up by their early STEM classes. Part of the problem is the huge mismatch between today's students and traditional (and increasingly expensive and bloated) textbooks, forcing instructors to teach with one hand tied behind their back. Meanwhile, the real power of the web for learning—interactivity—has barely been tapped.  So, we started creating zyBooks—STEM material native for the web—using ""less text, more action."" zyBooks have minimal text, and instead consist of question sets, animations, interactive tools, and embedded homework, so students can learn by doing. We developed a platform to author, deliver, and continually support and improve zyBooks, vowing to always do right by the student and instructor.  We keep prices as low as possible, provide the best support we can, and make the zyBook platform easy to use for students and instructors. zyBooks are collaboratively authored by talented teams of professors, content developers and software engineers.

Zymochem,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zymochem,"Biotechnology, Chemical, Industrial",Zymochem develop microbes & bioprocesses that enable profitable & eco-friendly production of chemicals from renewable sources such as sugar.,"The world they live in is built from petroleum. The paints on their walls, the carpets in their homes, the tires on their cars, the plastics for everyday consumer goods – these and many more products are made from chemicals that are mostly made from petroleum, creating a $3 trillion/yr industry. To fulfill their dependency on petroleum, they do crazy things like setting up oil rigs in the middle of the ocean and drilling several miles into the ocean floor! They’ve done these things because they have had no alternative to meet their needs. Not anymore! Over the past decade, advances in engineering microorganisms have afforded us the opportunity to make the same chemicals that are traditionally made from petroleum. Instead of requiring raw materials buried deep within the earth, microbes can use abundant and renewable sources of carbon such as sugars during processes akin to brewing beer. Despite the numerous advantages, making chemicals this way at the industrial level is still rare. This is because it’s still more expensive than using petroleum for producing the chemicals.  Although a few challenges need to be solved to usher in the era of renewable chemicals, a fundamental constraint that limits the economic competitiveness of using microbes is the loss of at least 33% of the carbon as carbon dioxide waste during the fermentation – think of this as the head on your beer. Because of this carbon loss, potential product is simply not made. In technical terms, the maximum achievable yields are 67%. As sugars are the most expensive component of a bioprocess, making the carbon dioxide waste translates to as much as 20% of total costs, which severely hampers the economics of the bioprocess and its competitiveness with petroleum-based production methods. At ZymoChem, they are re-imagining the microbe, one that is designed to eliminate (or substantially reduce) carbon loss during the production of chemicals. To do this, they had to design a completely new biosynthetic pathway – one that doesn’t exist in nature – to make the chemicals. Each individual step of this pathway is designed to not lose carbon as carbon dioxide, enabling their biosynthetic pathway to retain all of the sugar’s carbon into the final chemical product. This carbon conservation allows their approach to have superior theoretical yields, up to 50% better than existing state-of-the-art technology! In turn, their technology has the potential to substantially lower production costs and drastically improve cost-competitiveness for making a variety of chemicals from renewable sources, even at today's oil prices."

Nonetheless, upon seeing the potential that this tool could have within a company, a more corporate approach was given to it each time.  At the same time, the ""surname"" social and the 2.0 style was inundating the Internet and it was then that the decision was taken to add collaborative and communicative functionalities to it that later converted it to what it is today: an intranet 2.0 or company social network.  This part of Zyncro‘s trajectory is what Didac Lee, founder of Grupo Inspirit, considers the a ""Journey accross the desert"", which all startups must endure.

Many services. Many devices. Zypr aggregates proprietary 3rd-party APIs, categorizes their functions and then presents those functions through a single, normalized API with full voice control on a wide range of platforms, including mobile, desktop, consumer electronics devices and auto infotainment.  By aggregating and normalizing 3rd party APIs, Zypr creates a stable access point for devices and apps to access those services without concern for service and API changes. Zypr’s voice client adapter entity provides voice control over all services regardless of provider or category. As such, Zypr enables a powerful natural language voice control metaphor for accessing a wide variety of service types. For example, instead of speaking to a single POI vendor like Yelp, a client can speak to the Zypr POI client adapter entity and have a single point of access to all the POI services integrated through Zypr. As services change or get swapped out, the client can continue to use POI services without any code changes. Also, by creating a single sign-on for the user, Zypr enables a unified service profile for the user across multiple devices. In addition, by creating a meta-level of access by service category, Zypr creates a unique ability for compelling mash-ups across services. For example, instead of mashing up “Twitter” with “Tuner2”, a Zypr client can integrate Social Networking and Internet Radio generically such that no matter what services are selected by the end user, the two services are integrated through Zypr. This effect is both a benefit to the end user and a dramatic simplification for the developer."
