With Zunum Aero, simply drive to a nearby airfield and walk to your aircraft with bags in tow, for a trip that will take half the time and at a much lower fare. Or skip the meeting altogether, and be on the slopes in Tahoe by 8:40 AM for $100 round-trip, and back home the same evening. We are a land of towns and communities, many with airports, but few with regular air service. Our stock of 13,500 airports is the largest in the world, yet just 140 of the largest hubs carry over 97% of air traffic. This has left many of us with long drives to catch a flight, while on shorter trips we skip air travel altogether. Communities without good air service also struggle to attract investment and create jobs. Electric aircraft of varying sizes are ideally suited to this critical need, requiring little support other than a GPS flight path and a quick recharge or swap facility on the tarmac. Be it Moses Lake, Beaumont, Santa Fe or Butte: prepare for the convenience of frequent electric air service. Did you know that short-haul flights produce over 40% of aviation emissions? With our aircraft, we believe these will be largely eliminated within twenty years. Our aircraft are “hybrids to electrics” that sip fuel only when they have to, will use even less over time as batteries upgrade, and will one day go completely without — so that flying will be kind to the Earth."

Starting from positive R&D and design, integrating global resources, based in the headquarters in Ninghai, and relying on the R&D centers in Italy, Japan, Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin and the production bases in Lanzhou, Jinan, Yinan, and Ninghai, ZHIDOU has developed a global R&D and technological innovation organization system and a modern manufacturing pattern to build lightweight, miniaturized, intelligent and interconnected micro pure electric vehicles for users and promote ecological changes in transportation.         ZHIDOU is a new force in the field of new energy vehicles.

After entering the domestic market in May 2014, ZHIDOU has quickly been recognized in the market and favored by consumers due to its precise positioning, affordability, smart and convenient body design, and outstanding environmental protection and safety performance.         By June 2017, it had sold more than 72,000 vehicles, accounting for 6% of domestic new energy vehicle market and 15% of the pure electric passenger vehicles segment. Since 2012, ZHIDOU has left its footprint in 15 countries: Italy, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Slovenia, Slovakia, Croatia, Spain, Germany, Marston, Austria, Brazil, South Korea and Colombia. Its domestic and overseas promotion efforts paid off. In Italy, as the only designated vehicle of Share’N GO’ s vehicle sharing project, ZHIDOU boosted the improvement of traffic ecology in Europe and became one of the independent brand benchmarks in the international market.         At present, new changes have occurred to the traveling mode. ZHIDOU keeps up with the times and creatively proposes the concept of Micro-Traveling that focuses on solving the traveling demand in the last kilometer of urban traffic. Carrying with the mission of building electric vehicles that lead the era, ZHIDOU works with upstream and downstream partners in the fields of finance, capital, IT, intelligence, and the Internet of things to build a symbiotic, mutually complementary, and regenerative eco-big data platform of Micro-Traveling in the industry community that involves people, vehicles, roads, and traveling.

Zidisha,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zidisha,"Micro Lending, Non Profit, Social Entrepreneurship",Zidisha is a microlending community that directly connects lenders and borrowers through its platform.,"Zidisha is the only peer-to-peer lending service to connect individual lenders directly with microfinance borrowers in low-income countries. Zidisha is based on the conviction that small-scale entrepreneurs in developing countries are capable of interacting responsibly with peer-to-peer lenders via a self-regulating web platform, without needing local intermediaries to communicate and manage loan transactions on their behalf.  Though there are other microlending websites that allow individuals to contribute funds toward microloans of their choice, all of them rely on local microfinance organizations to communicate with lenders, create loan applications and collect repayments. In these intermediated microlending platforms, the communication is all one way, so that the borrower is often unaware of the lenders who funded his or her loan. The average intermediary organization adds over 30% - sometimes as much as 100% - in fees and interest to loans raised through these websites to cover its own administrative expenses. Such high interest rates reduce borrowers' profits, sometimes to the point of making them poorer than they were before they received the loan. Unlike the postings on other microlending platforms, the loan applications and comments posted on Zidisha's loan pages are written by the borrowers themselves. This opens the way for dialogue between lenders and borrowers, so that lenders can receive answers to their inquiries about the loan and business directly from the entrepreneur they are funding. Eliminating unnecessary intermediaries also decreases cost of the loans. The average Zidisha borrower pays only about 8% (flat rate) in annual interest and fees, including interest paid out to lenders. This is far below the rates traditionally charged for microfinance loans in developing countries.  Reducing interest costs allows the entrepreneurs to keep more of their profits, so that the loans have greater impact in reducing poverty."

Zymochem,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zymochem,"Biotechnology, Chemical, Industrial",Zymochem develop microbes & bioprocesses that enable profitable & eco-friendly production of chemicals from renewable sources such as sugar.,"The world they live in is built from petroleum. The paints on their walls, the carpets in their homes, the tires on their cars, the plastics for everyday consumer goods – these and many more products are made from chemicals that are mostly made from petroleum, creating a $3 trillion/yr industry. To fulfill their dependency on petroleum, they do crazy things like setting up oil rigs in the middle of the ocean and drilling several miles into the ocean floor! They’ve done these things because they have had no alternative to meet their needs. Not anymore! Over the past decade, advances in engineering microorganisms have afforded us the opportunity to make the same chemicals that are traditionally made from petroleum. Instead of requiring raw materials buried deep within the earth, microbes can use abundant and renewable sources of carbon such as sugars during processes akin to brewing beer. Despite the numerous advantages, making chemicals this way at the industrial level is still rare. This is because it’s still more expensive than using petroleum for producing the chemicals.  Although a few challenges need to be solved to usher in the era of renewable chemicals, a fundamental constraint that limits the economic competitiveness of using microbes is the loss of at least 33% of the carbon as carbon dioxide waste during the fermentation – think of this as the head on your beer. Because of this carbon loss, potential product is simply not made. In technical terms, the maximum achievable yields are 67%. As sugars are the most expensive component of a bioprocess, making the carbon dioxide waste translates to as much as 20% of total costs, which severely hampers the economics of the bioprocess and its competitiveness with petroleum-based production methods. At ZymoChem, they are re-imagining the microbe, one that is designed to eliminate (or substantially reduce) carbon loss during the production of chemicals. To do this, they had to design a completely new biosynthetic pathway – one that doesn’t exist in nature – to make the chemicals. Each individual step of this pathway is designed to not lose carbon as carbon dioxide, enabling their biosynthetic pathway to retain all of the sugar’s carbon into the final chemical product. This carbon conservation allows their approach to have superior theoretical yields, up to 50% better than existing state-of-the-art technology! In turn, their technology has the potential to substantially lower production costs and drastically improve cost-competitiveness for making a variety of chemicals from renewable sources, even at today's oil prices."

Founded in 2009 by entrepreneurs with experience in the grocery industry, the Company’s mission is to bring high-quality, farm-fresh food direct to consumers at wholesale prices. Rather than work through distributors, warehouses and grocery store channels, Zaycon fills its trucks with food sourced from the farm based on pre-order demand and delivers the food directly to the customer, thus preserving freshness, taste and nutrition. Zaycon’s customers pre-order their food choices online and then pick up their orders at pre-determined local locations (often large and centrally-located parking lots). Furthermore, by removing the middlemen, Zaycon is able to offer the lowest prices, providing customers with savings of up to 50% compared to prices at traditional grocery stores. In addition, Zaycon’s proprietary business model requires no fixed assets, no warehousing and zero waste all while collecting up-front customer payments prior to delivery. The Company currently offers a wide range of fresh foods including poultry, beef, pork, seafood and fresh fruit and delivers to more than 1,200 locations – through ~7,000 sales events – across 48 states. Zaycon is well positioned for rapid growth within the fast-growing online grocery market.

Additionally, average sales per customer have increased 250% since 2010 as customers continue to purchase with higher frequency and higher spending per order. Along with ongoing grassroots marketing efforts, recently adopted online marketing campaigns have shown exceptional early success and present an opportunity to exponentially grow the Zaycon brand name and customer base."

He wondered why kids were constantly trying to adapt to computers rather than having the computers adapt to them. After talking with dozens of other parents, it became clear that they were all equally frustrated with the experiences their children were having online. While parents universally believed that the computer could help their kids learn, they just didn't have the time or resources to scour the web and find any of this fun, educational content themselves. Additionally, parents wanted more say over what their children were doing online. Without trusted content, they really didn't want to open up the whole, sometimes scary, web to their young kids. Mark decided it was time to build a safe, fun, and educational online experience for kids that also gave parents the information and control they wanted. After discussing the idea with his friend, Rich, they decided to form a company to build Zoodles. â€¨ Since then, the team has grown to include incredibly talented engineers, educational experts, and creative designers who understand how to build simple interfaces for kids. The team is excited to be working on a product that can change how children learn while giving parents an active role in the experience. We hope that you enjoy Zoodles as much as we do! â€¨"
