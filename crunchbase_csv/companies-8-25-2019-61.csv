Loxo Oncology is committed to bringing targeted cancer therapies rapidly into the clinic that have an opportunity for outsized clinical effects in genetically defined patient populations. Loxo Oncology derives its company name from an attendant of the Greek goddess Artemis, who represented the concept of trajectory in the sport of archery. It is an exciting time to develop cancer drugs. Diagnostic methods are yielding strong clues about which cancer features are actionable, “driver mutations,” in contrast to those merely along for the ride as “passenger mutations.” In the last five years, these insights have transformed the standard of care in melanoma, lung cancer and other cancers. Picking a target is just the first step in building a cancer drug. Good chemists build good drugs. The physical properties of a compound have much to do with its ultimate success or failure. Is it stable? Is it soluble? Is it absorbed? Does it reach its target? Does it engage the target? Does it cause toxicity elsewhere in the body before it achieves maximum efficacy in the cancer? In our opinion, drugs that achieve excellent exposure in the body and are highly specific for their intended targets have the highest chances of success. Once an attractive target is selected and a drug with best-in-class properties is constructed, setting up the right clinical development plan is of utmost importance. Our goal is to generate a clinical path that reflects the underlying scientific hypothesis that made the drug interesting in the first place. This often means developing the drug in a population of patients whose tumors possess a specific genetic vulnerability targeted by the drug. Loxo Oncology was built around a team of full-time professionals and engaged scientific advisors who are aligned in choosing the most actionable targets, and pursuing them through disciplined clinical trial approaches. Our license and collaboration agreement with Array Biopharma and our experienced team allows us to construct drugs with best-in-class properties from the ground up."

If the CRISPR RNA is matched to a complementary DNA sequence, the Cas proteins will cleave the invading DNA. Locus Biosciences designs and creates novel CRISPR RNAs and uses a powerful CRISPR-Cas system, referred to as Cascade/Cas3, that kills target bacteria by irreversibly destroying the bacterial DNA. The irreversible destruction of DNA is the primary differentiator between Cas3 and Cas9, as Cas9 makes double-stranded breaks that can be repaired by the cell.

LOCIcoin utility tokens are used exclusively within the LOCI suite of products for the purposes of searching, analyzing, staking and exchanging Intellectual Property. LOCI Search provides a unique and patented Venn Diagram IP search tool for FREE (https://www.locisearch.com/) LOCI Invention Analysis helps new inventors determine the novelty and demand (undergoing further development) for their ideas before they spend money trying to patent. This is a huge cost savings of about 95% compared to traditional patent attorney searches. LOCI Invention Analysis can also help guide inventors toward “white space” where there are relatively few existing patents, where demand is high, so the inventor has the best possible chance of being awarded a patent, and/or selling their idea. Inventors can submit multiple iterations to help refine their idea and identify alternative applications of their invention. The ultimate goal of the inventor while using Invention Analysis is to achieve a optimal “LOCI Score” which indicates that their idea is unique, and in high demand. Once an inventor has refined their idea to feel confident that it is unique and in high demand, then they will be able to easily translate their idea into a provisional patent application using the LOCI system that is directly filed with the USPTO (in development), as well as stake their claim on the blockchain, which provides an immutable, undisputable time-stamp of the staked idea. This protects the invention for a period of 12 months at a very low cost. Visit https://loci.io for more information!"

There are 6bn daily commutes in the world and we aim to be the Airbnb of carpooling. EU ranked us in the top 5 among 11,000 innovation projects for H2020! What is the catch? We have an unfair advantage. We are based in Istanbul! It is crowded, and terrible by means of public transportation. Cars are 2.5 times more expensive, car fuel is 3 times more expensive than US – yet income is low by western standards. What’s more; its road infrastructure forces 18 million people to squeeze in 4 main arteries for journeys that can take up to 2.5 hours each way. In our pilots they are much more eager to turn the daily misery of commute to a new medium for comfort, cost sharing, and social connectivity compared to elsewhere.

Misconceptions about the role of risk management, and how to accomplish it effectively, have resulted in countless organizations falling victim to preventable disasters. Preventable, that is, if only those companies had established an effective ERM program.   In 2005, LogicManager CEO, Steven Minsky, recognized the opportunity for organizations to adopt a risk based approach. Risk was the driver – the common factor – between all governance functions, so how could embracing it not result in huge gains in efficiency, productivity, and ultimately bottom line value?   Building on years of experience in risk and business process management at leading technology firms like Apple, Steven founded LogicManager, and built the LogicManager platform on patent-pending Taxonomy technology; designed to revolutionize how organization’s approached risk management.   Since 2005, LogicManager’s risk management platform and mentoring services has provided a foundation for ERM programs to thousands of organizations worldwide. LogicManager’s success is built on three core values: customer satisfaction, risk management expertise, and cost effective innovation. Their software-as-a-service package is easy to adopt and allows for very quick implementations. Access can be granted in as little as one business day, and full-business implementation takes less than 90 days, guaranteed.  Their multi-tenant structure also fuels improvement; the platform is constantly honed by feedback from customers just like yourself. It’s the users themselves that drive its evolution. LogicManager’s architecture also facilitates, and even encourages, customization. You can more easily and cheaply customize the tool than you can other hosted cloud or on-premise solutions. In fact, customizations don’t cost anything at all — you’ll never pay beyond your base subscription. Tailor the platform to your needs, no matter how specific. Your business analysts won’t need to go to the development team to write new code, because “customizations” are really configurations. This drastically reduces the likelihood of downtime due to broken code."

LocName: Global Addressing Systems,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/locname--gps-address-book,"Apps, GPS, Location Based Services","LocName is a new global addressing system that allows residents/businesses to choose their own address, giving the world freedom of address.","LocName, short for “Location Name”, is a new global addressing system (GAS) that allows residents/businesses to pick their own address. As it stands today, every country has their own specific addressing system; USA has zip codes, Canada has postal codes, some countries don't even have names for all their streets! The only unified system which is accepted globally is the GPS coordinates system, which is a long stream of numbers that is too hard to memorize, share, and reach. What LocName does is combines these two pieces of information (address details, and GPS coordinates) under one unique, personalized name picked by the users themselves. Our first products are the LocName web and mobile applications that are targeted towards everyday residents and business locations. How the App Works: Users of one of our apps (iOs, Android, or Web) will allow the app to find their current location using GPS. They will then give that location a name, or what we like to call a LocName (users can also edit additional details and privacy settings for their place). Thats all it takes! That place now has a new, memorable address that can be shared with friends and clients looking to reach that location. Users can use GPS navigation to reach any LocName location. By saving a list of favorite friends' places and business locations, users will have an address book of GPS locations accessible to them straight from their pocket. The LocName API Our second product is one targeted towards e-commerce websites that will help capture accurate customer location details to help curb the loss in revenue due to human error in inputting faulty address details. Today e-commerce websites experience about 8% of revenue lost from customers entering faulty address information into their systems. Being a multi-billion dollar industry, the loss of total revenue is immense. LocName is currently working on the LocName API which will capture customers' address details as well as their GPS coordinates, doubly confirming each customers location details. Users can choose the enter either piece of information (address details or physical map location) while the other will be automatically filled in based on information from the first field. All information will go through a verification process based on previous successful deliveries to addresses with the same details. Delivery Optimizer In the future, LocName will work on a counterpart to the LocName API targeted towards delivery service providers and couriers. By fully integrating LocName's technology into their system, we will be able to cut down delivery times and errors by providing accurate customer locations and information relevant to the delivery process. Features: -Simplify your address by giving it a unique LocName.  -Any combination of GPS coordinates can be saved as a LocName. Save any location in the world!  -Share your unique LocName with your friends and clients by email, text or putting it on your business cards and flyers.  -Use GPS Navigation to reach yours and others' locations by simply searching the LocName on one of our apps.  -Create an address book of favourite locations where you can save and access your most used LocNames.  -Adjust the privacy settings of each one of your LocNames to whether you want it to viewed privately or publicly.  -Sign in with Facebook to see who of your friends are using LocName and invite those who are not!"

Looking4.com,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/looking4parking-com,Parking,Looking4.com is an airport parking website.,"Looking4Parking.com is a website providing price comparison and bookings for On-Site, Off-Site, Park & Ride and Meet & Greet parking at all the UKâ€:tm:s major airports and seaports. The business was founded by Dave Greenbrown, Adam Casper & Martin Mansell in early 2010. The groupâ€:tm:s first office was based in Daveâ€:tm:s house in Kippax, Leeds, but the rapid expansion of the business meant that a move was necessary, seeing the ever-growing team move to offices in Barnsley before finally moving back to a new Leeds city centre office, which they currently share with notable design and events giants Logistik. Martin said the trio started the business because: â€œWe felt the online airport parking market was confusing, cluttered and difficult to shop in and so we saw the opportunity for a simple website and booking engine that was guaranteed to find the best deals and lowest prices""  The company vision is simple, yet effective - â€œTo be the first airport parking brand which springs to mind. To be innovators in terms of web and mobile technologyâ€ - and this vision has been the driving force behind the looking4parking.com ethos.  July 2011 will see the launch of a new, innovative website boasting a slick design, enhanced features and an improved customer experience. The month will also see Looking4Parking moving into the mobile app market as they prepare to launch their collaboration with iPhone App developers Pink Gorilla, offering information, bookings and discounts directly to the shoppersâ€:tm: hands.  Business Development Executive George Wall believes the key to Looking4Parkingâ€:tm:s success is due to the companies willingness to adapt to new technologies.  â€œThe world is changing, people donâ€:tm:t communicate via the traditional methods any more. New media such as Twitter, mobile apps, Facebook and viral marketing are a far more effective way to engage your audience, and I believe the reason weâ€:tm:re doing so well is because we acknowledge that.â€  Company director Martin Mansell also realises that the internet is a crucial part of the business.  â€œOur websites tick all the boxes in terms of usability and optimisation, giving our customers a first class experience from search to booking and beyond. Our knowledge of SEO has also been instrumental â€“ enabling us to maximise our online exposure while keeping our advertising budget under control.â€"
