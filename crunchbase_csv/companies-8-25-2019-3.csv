AdaSky delivers a scalable solution, priced for mass market, that was built to meet the specific and demanding requirements of autonomous vehicles.  AdaSky saw a powerful opportunity in the market. The most basic need for autonomous vehicles is to be able to see and interpret all objects and surroundings, in all conditions. Existing sensors and cameras available today can’t meet this need on their own. To address this, AdaSky engineered a state-of-the-art sensing and perception solution that allows autonomous vehicles to reliably detect, segment, and analyze pedestrians, animals, objects, and road conditions in day or night, regardless of weather condition.  Today’s sensors are limited and often have trouble classifying objects. AdaSky’s advanced thermal sensing solution allows the vehicle to sense and analyze its surroundings by passively collecting FIR signals through detection of thermal energy radiated from objects and their body heat. AdaSky introduces a new modality in which the signals come from a different band of the spectrum, orthogonal to existing imaging solutions. AdaSky’s image processing and computer vision algorithms process the signals collected by the camera to provide accurate object detection and scene analysis, giving the vehicle a new layer of information and the ability to precisely detect pedestrians 200 meters away or more, allowing more distance in which to react to driving decisions. FIR technology has been used for decades in other vertical industries, making it a mature and proven concept with demonstrated scalable technology priced for mass market. AdaSky leveraged this mature technology and adapted it specifically for autonomous vehicles to create a solution that complements other sensing technology, such as Lidar, Radar, and standard cameras, while providing a crucial additional layer of vision and brains. In fact, AdaSky’s solution is performing at its best in use cases when other sensors in the car have no perception and are unable to see. When combined with other sensors, AdaSky’s solution gives autonomous vehicles perception of their surroundings in any condition.  AdaSky is a quick-moving start-up, comprised of an experienced team that combines image-processing and thermal sensing industry vets from the Israeli high-tech market, automotive experts, and machine-learning and computer-vision specialists.  AdaSky was founded with the core vision of advancing the autonomous vehicle market with a bold perception solution that increases the safety and performance of the self-driving car.

We are adding low-dose 3D capability – digital tomosynthesis - to planar X-ray while making it more affordable and truly portable so radiology can more easily travel to the patient. This transformation will enhance patient’s access to the world’s most important imaging technologies and likely increases the diagnostic accuracy for many high incidence conditions such as cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, lung cancer and osteoporosis.  The last two decades have seen a transformation in radiology as detectors have evolved from film to digital semiconductor based devices. The next transformation will see the source switching from a single high dose acquisition to multiple very low dose acquisitions from distributed points so that more information (including 3D) can be gained from less dose. Among other benefits, the ongoing technological transformation of radiology will bring about significant cost savings.  Current X-ray equipment requires a choice between high-cost 3D or lower-cost (but still expensive) 2D. All are large bulky solutions. Some are ‘moveable’ rather than truly portable. Low-cost truly portable systems based on Adaptix’ technology will allow clinicians to have easy access to 3D imaging information which can enhance the diagnostic information and likely impact patient care.  Adaptix will transform radiology with its development of new Flat Panel X-ray source, a pixelated array made in a semiconductor foundry.

Adenium focuses on the development and commercialization of novel antibiotics for the treatment of multi drug resistant bacterial infections. Our  focus is treatment of nosocomial infections, in particular complicated urinary tract infections and hospital or ventilator acquired pneumonia caused by multi drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria.  Complicated urinary tract infections are caused by predominantly Gram-negative bacteria and in particular Escherichia coli. E. coli is also a frequent cause of many other common bacterial infections such as  cholecystitis, bacteremia, cholangitis and traveler’s diarrhea, as well as other clinical infections such as neonatal meningitis and pneumonia. Most Infections caused by Escherichia coli are relative easy to cure, however, hospital adapted strains of Escherichia coli are often multi-resistant and are able to cause life threatening infections. Hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator acquired pnemonia (VAP) are also indications dominated by Gram-negative bacteria and in particular Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. P. aeruginosa has become an important cause of infection, especially in patients with compromised host defense mechanisms. It is the most common pathogen isolated from patients who have been hospitalized longer than 1 week and it is a frequent cause of nosocomial infections such as pneumonia, UTIs, and bacteremia. Infections caused by Klebsiella and Pseudomonas are complicated since many Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains are multi drug resistant. Infections caused by Acinetobacter are rare and most strains found outside hospitals are sensitive to antibiotics. While Acinetobacter poses few risks to healthy individuals, a few species, particularly Acinetobacter baumannii, can cause serious infections – mainly in very ill trauma and hospitalized patients increasing the post trauma mortality as seen in wounded soldiers in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The most common Acinetobacter infections include pneumonia, bacteraemia, wound infections, and urinary tract infections. ‘Hospital-adapted’ strains of Acinetobacter are often resistant to antibiotics and are increasingly difficult to treat. Adenium Biotech strives to find a novel treatment for multi-resistant Acinetobacter. Arenicin is a non haemolytic and non cytotoxic 21 amino acids antimicrobial peptide isolated from the lugworm. Arenicin has a strong and selective efficacy against Gram negative bacteria as well as a broad therapeutic window. Ten Arenicin variants were selected and subjected to a ranking program consisting of toxicology as well as in vitro and in vivo efficacy profiling. The three highest ranking Arenicin variants were selected in December 2013 for final lead optimization and selection of an Arenicin lead product candidate early in the fourth quarter 2013.

The method entails that the utilization of energy potential in biogas plants can be increased from the current approx. The method includes facilities for optimized utilization of partially degassed biomass for the production of growth media for fungal production, phosphorus fertilizers and increased bioenergy. The concept uses partially degassed biomass for the production of fungal substrates. The ability of the fungi to degrade cellulose, hemi-cellulose and the like in biomass is used to ensure increased and efficient utilization of the total energy potential of the biomass. The use of AST mushroom substrate in pill form will, unlike conventional substrate, be stockfast, easier to handle and provide significantly improved working environment during production as well as be cheaper to manufacture. The plant concept consists of a number of well-known technologies composed in a new and innovative way, ensuring the highest possible energy recycling. AST production unit can be implemented as an addition to a biogas plant or fungus production plant. The AST solution is based on applied patents relating to methods for treatment and utilization of organic matter and biomass in a single plant concept. The concept includes anaerobic fermentation (fermentation without oxygen) followed by separation of degassed biomass with fiber fraction production. After drying and conditioning, the fiber fraction is the basic raw material for the production of substrate for the cultivation of fungi. After fungal cultivation, the spent substrate can be recycled as biomass for the production of biogas."

Adaptive Path,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/adaptivepath,"Brewing, Consulting, Events, Information Technology, Messaging, Product Design, Web Design",Adaptive Path helps organizations develop product concepts through experience strategy and deliver those through designs.,"Adaptive Path helps organizations develop product concepts through experience strategy and deliver on those concepts through experience design. In the fall of 2000, as the bubble was bursting, Peter Merholz sent an email to the future co-founders of Adaptive Path. He was thinking of striking out on his own but didn’t want to go solo. And he wanted to focus exclusively on user experience problems. Despite the chaos of the market, it was clear there was a demand for user experience services. Were they interested in joining forces? A few months later in March of 2001, probably the worst time to start a business, Adaptive Path was launched at SXSW on the rooftop of the old Waterloo Brewing Company. From the very beginning, the company has worked with recognizable brands on hairy problems. NPR and PeopleSoft were the first two Adaptive Path clients. Other early clients include Intel, UN Relief Web, PBS, and Wells Fargo. It was important to the founders to approach client work differently than most consultancies. No telling clients how to do business. No forcing a rigid methodology. The Adaptive Path way was purposefully flexible—based on what was learned from clients during the course of each engagement. That flexibility and the ability to respond to emergent forces and to include clients in the process were crucial to Adaptive Path’s early success and continue to inform the practice today. Another founding principle was openness of ideas. Not only amongst each other, but with the community that was forming around user experience. With missionary zeal, the founders spread the word about UX, writing about it, speaking at conferences and leading workshops on user experience. It was clear people were hungry for more. In 2002, co-founder Jesse James Garrett published The Elements of User Experience, to help explain user experience to non UX folks. It has become a classic in the field, taught widely in college courses. Also that year, with the first public workshop in Chicago, the Adaptive Path events line of business was launched, offering some of the only hands-on training available for UX professionals. The following year, UX Week, Adaptive Path’s flagship event, kicked off in Washington, D.C. Today it is considered the premier user experience conference, drawing hundreds of UX professionals from all over the world. In addition to sharing ideas and furthering the practice, there was Ajax. In 2005, Jesse coined the term in an effort to help a client understand the concept of rich interaction with native Web technologies. Coining the word helped the idea take off, and placed Adaptive Path firmly in the middle of the Web 2.0 revolution. We worked with Blogger (after it was acquired by Google), and Flickr. In 2006, Measure Map, an analytics tool for bloggers that we built in-house, was bought by Google. Then there was Charmr. In 2007, Adaptive Path’s R&D team took up the plea of diabetes blogger Amy Tenderich to create a product to make diabetes management less clunky and awkward and more sleek and seamless. The work was awarded patents and was responsible for opening the door for us to work in healthcare, an industry for which we are especially well suited. That same year, two new events launched. UX Intensive, a traveling four-day workshop series, and MX: Managing Experience, a conference for managers with a user experience mandate. We also opened our Austin office. In 2008, our book Subject to Change, published by O’Reilly, hit the shelves. It captured our philosophy in approaching the development of products and services. In 2009, there was a recession. We survived. (Whew.) The following year Adaptive Path Amsterdam opened for business. It’s been a great ten years. From a beginning in web user experience, doing upfront user research and information architecture to delivering wireframes, our work has evolved to being involved from strategy through visual design, tech and development across a wider variety of platforms and environments. We are routinely hired to take a crack at the tough problems and complex challenges our clients face and think only we can handle. We continue to seek the difficult, the crazy, the impossible and push ourselves and our clients ever forward. Since Adaptive Path’s inception UX has emerged from the backroom to the boardroom, going from something that’s “nice to have” to an essential element of successful products and services. Adaptive Path can take a little bit of the credit."

This is your opportunity to handcraft the life that your child dreams of… One that’s full of adventure, experienced with the person they love most–you! Adventures are exciting planned experiences, created by other parents just like you, and brought to you via the Adventure Clubs mobile app. Adventures are created and led by Adventure Leaders and may happen any day of the week. On any given adventure, there are usually 3 - 12 families including moms or dads, and their children (ages 6 months - 10 years). Imagine, every day opening up your Adventure Clubs app and being able to easily find what’s happening near you and then going on adventures alongside other families with kids!  It’s flexible too. You just adventure whenever it works for you–with no minimum, no maximum, no commitment at all. It’s easy and fun for parents, and incredible for kids!  With the Adventure Clubs app, you can: • Browse local adventures your family will enjoy • Choose and RSVP to adventures you like • Create your own adventures to experience with others • Invite your family and friends to adventure with you • Message co-adventurers before and after your adventure You can create or explore exciting local adventures in these twelve categories:  • Animals • Creative • Education • Environment • Food • Museums & Culture • Music & Dance • Parks & Playgrounds • Sports & Fitness • Transportation • Water Play • Other Through this app, we have loads of incredible, kid-friendly, local, family-oriented adventure options offered to us at our finger tips. Adventuring is experiential learning at it’s finest, and learning through experience is how kids learn best.  If you’d like to be an Adventure Leader, all you need is a great idea and you can create one on your Adventure Clubs app. You can set the adventure to “public” if you want to open it up to meet new friends or set it to “private” and invite only your current friends to join your adventure. There are two different kinds of adventures with Adventure Clubs:  • Everyday Adventures  • Premium Adventures An Everyday Adventure is something simple and easy to plan such as bike riding at a local park, hiking through the forest, getting hot chocolates and playing puzzles at a coffee shop, or making sandcastles on the beach. Forget about “play dates”-adventuring is way more fun!  A Premium Adventure is an extra special adventure that is set up by the Adventure Clubs team with a local Adventure Host, (a local business or non-profit organization). A Premium Adventure might be a special behind-the-scenes tour of a famous theater, or a baking class with a pastry chef, or a meet-n-greet with professional performers or athletes, a tour of a private jet. Adventure Clubs is always coming up with incredible ideas for Premium Adventures.  The price for each Premium Adventure is different and all of the information will be in the adventure description in the app and the amount for the Premium Adventure is to be paid directly to the Adventure Host (place of business or non-profit organization). Premium Adventures are led by our top leaders, who are hand-picked and trained by Adventure Clubs.  So what are you waiting for? Let’s go on an adventure!"

Their proprietary technology for engineering these versatile proteins creates an opportunity to rapidly generate highly differentiated medicines. Adnexus, a Bristol-Myers Squibb R&D Company, is a leader in the discovery and development of Adnectins, a proprietary type of targeted biologic. Adnectins are proteins designed to either block or stimulate therapeutic targets of interest to help fight diseases across a broad range of therapeutic areas. Our proprietary technology for engineering these proteins creates an opportunity to rapidly generate compounds for study as potential treatment options for patients. Targeted biologics are one of the most medically important and fastest growing areas in the biopharmaceutical industry. These drugs are specifically designed to attack targets of disease. Despite the success of the first generation targeted therapeutic products, such as antibodies, additional innovations are sought by the medical community to help meet unmet needs for improved safety, and efficacy. We believe the study of Adnectins can help to address these demands. Adnectins are derived from human fibronectin, an abundant extracellular protein that binds naturally to a number of different proteins. We create Adnectins using our proprietary protein engineering system called PROfusion™. Our scientists can rapidly create PROfusion libraries of more than 10 trillion different Adnectins. We then screen these libraries to identify Adnectins with the desired drug properties against therapeutic targets of interest. PROfusion enables discovery productivity by minimizing the timeframe for identifying high-quality candidates. In October 2007, Adnexus was acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. This acquisition has further accelerated our growth as an industry leader in the discovery and early development of proprietary targeted biologics. Together with Bristol-Myers Squibb, we are developing multiple Adnectin programs for use in the study of potential treatments in a broad range of disease types, including oncology, immunology, and cardiovascular disease."
