Soft Robotics Inc.,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/soft-robotics-inc-,"Advanced Materials, Industrial Automation, Robotics",Soft Robotics opens new markets to automation through the application and commercialization of its proprietary soft robotics technology.,"The business end of a robotic arm is the gripper. The March 2105 edition of Modern Materials Handling best describes the challenge when they wrote:  “Perhaps more than any other element of robotic development in warehousing and distribution, the end-of-arm tooling, or gripper, is the place that can make or break a robot’s success.”  Advancing gripper technology is the key to unlocking a new age of automation. An age where they can automate tote pick and pack for grocery distribution, bin picking of soft and delicate parts, e-commerce order fulfillment, fruit harvesting, luggage handling, and consumer goods packaging. The US fresh produce packing market alone represents a $27 billion retail market searching for automation solutions. Soft Robotics has demonstrated the ability to bring robotic product handling and packaging to this market.  These are problems of adaptability, complexity, and cost. The search for a more adaptable gripper has driven up the complexity of design to devices like servo grippers and complicated tool changing requirements. This complexity comes at a high price in gripper cost, the need for larger arms, and complex software and hardware integration.  Their revolutionary soft robotic technology, covered by more than 40 patents and applications, enables us to design and manufacture soft robotic hands that address the new unstructured world of automation and logistics.  Through their propriety knowledge of actuator geometry, material selection, and operating envelope, they can tune actuators to be force limiting with NO CLOSED LOOP FEEDBACK system required. Soft Robotics brings the highest level of adaptability, while lowering system complexity and total system cost. The adaptive nature of their technology allows a single grasper to handle an unprecedented range of objects, regardless of shape, size, or weight, with no tool or software changes between cycles.  We’ve demonstrated the ability to grasp bags of rice, raw food, bars of soap, boxes of toothpaste, and clothing all with a single device.  But soft does not mean weak. Their technology has the ability to scale from the smallest to the largest task. The result is an automation solution that can pack a tote for retail distribution, pick fruit off the vine, or easily handle a ten pound kettle bell.  They have demonstrated the speed and precision necessary to integrate into the factories and warehouses of today and the future, operating at speeds up to 130 picks per minute.Their system is plug and play with the most common industrial robots using industry standard protocols and vision systems.They have designed the system to be “robot and vision agnostic,” allowing the system to quickly and seamlessly integrate with the full range of robots, from small collaborative systems to high speed industrial packing cells.  Soft Robotics launched their industrial product at Automate 2015 in March 2015, Their produce handling system in June 2015, and started shipping in June 2015. They are now selling systems to their pilot customers. Soft Robotics is foundational technology that solves the problems of today and unlocks the future of automation."

Sinch,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sinch,"SaaS, Software, Telecommunications","Connect with customers and make engagement personal with our simple, programmable communication tools. | Sinch | Enriching Engagement","Sinch brings businesses & people closer with tools enabling personal engagement. Our cloud communications platform reaches every mobile phone on the planet, in seconds or less, through mobile messaging or voice & video calling.Back in 2008, our six founders set out to reinvent mobile messaging. They rented the shop window of a boutique travel agency in Stockholm and quickly set about launching the very first version of our messaging platform. The team recognized that businesses loved text messaging for its immediate reach and its ubiquity as a communications channel. Well, do you know anyone without a mobile phone? But making mobile messaging simple would be key to the success of their new business. With this simplicity in mind, they also recognized that the market was moving towards using cloud-based platforms, rather than building bespoke in-house tools and hiring expensive on-site development experts. And so their vision of mobile messaging was born! Today we are 500 people strong, with a local presence in over 40 locations. Our cloud platform now supports messaging, voice and video, and handles 25 billion API transactions per year. We’re proud to work with some of the world’s largest and most demanding customers, including 8 out of the 10 largest U.S. tech enterprises, as well as mobile operators all around the world. Though we’re growing quickly, we maintain the ethos of our humble beginnings. We know that our success hinges on the talent and motivation of our people, and that customers’ loyalty is built on trust. We take that trust seriously, knowing that businesses across the globe rely on our technology to engage and delight their customers. Our architecture is built to scale with our client’s needs. We have hundreds of direct connections to mobile operators, ensuring leading quality without middlemen. We’re a leader in our field, stock-listed at Nasdaq Stockholm, and a trusted software vendor to many mobile operators around the world. Technology is redrawing the boundaries for what’s possible. People expect brands to meet them as individuals, and our technology allows businesses of all sizes to do just that – providing personalization at scale! With a growing number of ways to communicate, businesses risk a fragmented customer journey unless they master and leverage the most relevant and engaging channels. That’s why our customers appreciate the tools and technology we provide for creating richer messages, with imagery and video, to turn notifications into conversations. We’ve come a long way, and we’re just scratching the surface of what’s possible, for us and for our clients. In 2019 we decided to unify our business under the Sinch brand – we’re excited about this next step in our journey. If you’ve known us as CLX Communications or Symsoft until now, you can rest assured that we’re as easy to work with as we always have been!"
