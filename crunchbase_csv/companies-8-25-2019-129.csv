Zidisha,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zidisha,"Micro Lending, Non Profit, Social Entrepreneurship",Zidisha is a microlending community that directly connects lenders and borrowers through its platform.,"Zidisha is the only peer-to-peer lending service to connect individual lenders directly with microfinance borrowers in low-income countries. Zidisha is based on the conviction that small-scale entrepreneurs in developing countries are capable of interacting responsibly with peer-to-peer lenders via a self-regulating web platform, without needing local intermediaries to communicate and manage loan transactions on their behalf.  Though there are other microlending websites that allow individuals to contribute funds toward microloans of their choice, all of them rely on local microfinance organizations to communicate with lenders, create loan applications and collect repayments. In these intermediated microlending platforms, the communication is all one way, so that the borrower is often unaware of the lenders who funded his or her loan. The average intermediary organization adds over 30% - sometimes as much as 100% - in fees and interest to loans raised through these websites to cover its own administrative expenses. Such high interest rates reduce borrowers' profits, sometimes to the point of making them poorer than they were before they received the loan. Unlike the postings on other microlending platforms, the loan applications and comments posted on Zidisha's loan pages are written by the borrowers themselves. This opens the way for dialogue between lenders and borrowers, so that lenders can receive answers to their inquiries about the loan and business directly from the entrepreneur they are funding. Eliminating unnecessary intermediaries also decreases cost of the loans. The average Zidisha borrower pays only about 8% (flat rate) in annual interest and fees, including interest paid out to lenders. This is far below the rates traditionally charged for microfinance loans in developing countries.  Reducing interest costs allows the entrepreneurs to keep more of their profits, so that the loans have greater impact in reducing poverty."

The metasearch-driven searches cover more of the Internet because they combine the most relevant returns from multiple search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, Ask, and Bing. InfoSpace's metasearch technology provides users with the ""best of the best"" results each time they search. InfoSpace metasearch helps advertisers achieve a much higher match rate than any other search engine and delivers more sponsored listings per commercial search. Sites hosting metasearch receive a higher pay-per-click rate, which is a key selling point when InfoSpace engages with potential private-label search customers. Major search engines can benefit by building their networks through InfoSpace metasearch sites and through the private-label search solutions they create for customers who want to offer a preferred search resource under their own brand."

In 1971 an injection-blow moulded scintillation vial was developed. This was the first plastic scintillation vial to be produced with a uniform wall thickness, seamless bottom and a gas tight self-sealing cap. Under the trade name “Polyvial” this vial became the quality standard for scintillation vials worldwide. Since then millions have been produced every year. In 1976 the first plastic miniature vials for scintillation counting was produced. Under the name “Minis” they are now used extensively, especially in Europe and Japan. The “Minilabor”, a micro scale laboratory “kit in a case” was introduced to the market in 1989, introducing semimicro-scale Chemistry for research and education. Minilabor is now in use for chemistry education in schools and universities in Germany, Austria, Belgium, France, Ireland, Switzerland, Turkey and many other countries all over the world. With steady growth of the Company, 1979 saw the Analytical Instruments Division set-up to market and service scintillation counters and HPLC instrumentation. The Instruments Division entered 1984 with the introduction of automatic pipetting systems to the market for liquid handling. As a distributor for Tecan, Switzerland more than 500 complete systems were installed between 1984 and 1992. Most of these were built for very special applications with very specific software. The Company has provided the first fully automatic systems for HIV testing in blood banks (1985), the first multiple peptide synthesizer (SMPS 350 in 1989) and pioneered the automation of PCR-based tests in clinical diagnosis (1995). ZINSSER ANALYTIC (UK) LTD. was formed in 1983 to manufacture liquid scintillation cocktails, plastic scintillators and special liquid handling systems. Under the trade names “Quickszint”, “Quicksafe” and “Aquasafe” many different scintillation cocktails are marketed in Europe. Plastic scintillators for neutron, alpha and beta detectors and high energy physics applications are sold to research laboratories and industrial companies all over the world. In 1989, the production of the unique peristaltic dispenser system “Perifill” and “Trayscanner” commenced. In 1992, Werner Zinßer started a new company, ILS Innovative Labor Systeme GmbH in Stützerbach with 3 experts in micro syringes and micro glassware. The Company produces micro syringes, valves and OEM-parts for liquid handling systems. The company is growing consistently. In 2004 the sales organisation ZINSSER NA was formed with 2 partners for the exclusive distribution and support of Zinsser Analytic´s automatic systems. A staff of 6 persons (3 sales & support, 1 marketing, 2 service) are promoting successfully the company in the USA to the major pharma and chemistry companies."

This allows you to:  * Keep your tag space organized — you don't end up with ""New_York,"" ""New-York"" and ""NewYork"" — Zigtag has only one ""New York (the city)"" (although you can search for using ""NY,"" ""NYC"" or even ""Big Apple"")  * Search for your bookmarks quickly and efficiently — the type-ahead helps you choose from tags you've used and also shows their definitions  * Find what others have tagged effectively — no confusion between ""Stock (soup base),"" ""Stock (equities)"" or ""Stock (inventory)""   Zigtag also has a major social networking component; you can see what your friends are tagging and create and join special interest groups. The sidebar notifies you when your friends tag something new, and a news feed allows you to see what your friends are tagging at a glance. It's kind of a ""personal Digg""—your friends' interesting sites are likely to be interesting to you.

This ethos then led to our goal of launching a business truly dedicated to providing a curated range of home textiles, from plain collections through to artist driven collections.  Our goal is to offer a truly diverse range of designs and products that have not been seen before in the home. Unlike most other brands with a strict commercial goal, ZigZagZurich is a new way of working with artists and illustrators of the next generation, connecting them to a wider consumer market which is clearly interested in less commerce but more art and design with simple attention to detail and quality, exquisite design and fair price.

Why did you have to stand in line at the shipping store just to put a label on? With that, the idea for ZipShipit was born.

So now with ZipShipit you can compare prices from multiple carriers like UPS & USPS (Other carriers to be added soon) to find the most economical price. However, no matter which carrier you choose, you will still get a lower rate than at the local shipping store or post office. Therefore, after months of negotiating with UPS & USPS on your behalf, you can now ship from the comfort and convenience of your own home or business for rates up to 40% less than the shipping stores or post office."

Their goal is to provide all Canadians access to short term loans and to meet their cash flow needs without impacting their credit by leveraging their jewelry, gold, diamonds, watches, and precious metals. Zillidy is a personal asset lender that acts like your own personal private banker. They enable you to tap the equity that exists in your personal assets, stuff that you love dearly and don’t want to lose, so that you can get a short term loan whenever you need it by using the same asset over and over again. Zillidy is like having a home equity line of credit on your personal assets – but with some major benefits. A Zillidy loan will never impact your credit score and Zillidy will never show up on your credit report. They have a background in asset based lending to small and medium sized companies in Canada and the US. Through that experience, they have identified an opportunity to offer the same service, rates and value that they provide to business owners to everyone in Canada. They believe that access to capital shouldn’t be limited to the “big guys” who have lots of assets to use as collateral. Anyone with a single personal asset should be able to unlock the value of that asset to meet their cash flow needs without any fear of hurting their credit. Their service is unique. Although they hold your asset for you in their secure facility throughout the loan period, they are not an online pawn shop. They are more like a private bank. They only earn their  revenue through charging interest on their loans. There are no other fees or charges on a Zillidy loan. This means that their incentive is to loan the most money they possibly can on any asset.  In the unlikely scenario where you choose to default (which will never impact your credit score or be reported to any credit bureau), they will manage the sale process of the asset on your behalf. Once they have recovered the amount that is owed to us, they will remit back to you the remainder of the recovered amount. Although the reality of the loan business is that there will inevitably be defaults, they are not in the business of liquidating assets. They work tirelessly with their clients to meet their needs to avoid this, but in case a default does need to occur, their clients rest assured knowing that they will always get full value for their asset with Zillidy."

Many of the die-cast and injection-molded products have complex designs, which require high-quality workmanship and decorative details, with pad printing with up to one hundred imprints. The most complex of these models incorporates up to 20 moveable parts.  Zindart Manufacturing addresses the market need for vendors that can manufacture high-quality products in the required volumes and in a timely and cost-effective manner.

This coordinated, one-stop production process provides the Zindart Manufacturing's customers with 1) shortened lead times from design to production, 2) a single participant in the manufacturing process instead of multiple participants and 3) increased efficiency, resulting in lower per-unit costs.  The die-cast and injection-molded scale model replicas manufactured by Zindart Manufacturing are sold through hobby shops, collectors' clubs, car and equipment dealers, toy and gift stores and other channels.  Zindart Manufacturing has successfully developed long-term relationships with many of its principal customers, including Hallmark, for which Zindart Manufacturing has been a leading supplier of collectible holiday ornaments since 1982.

The production of Keepsake Ornaments requires highly developed hand spray-painting skills and attention to quality by each member of Zindart Manufacturing's workforce in order to meet Hallmark's exacting aesthetic and quality requirements. The Company also started business relationships with Mattel in 1997 to include die-cast collectibles. Now, Mattel is one of the Zindart Manufacturing's major customers.  Develop additional major customers Zindart Manufacturing Ltd has a core group of large customers, but also manufactures products for many smaller customers.

Diversify product offerings - Zindart is diversifying its product offerings to include the manufacture of other consumer products that utilize Zindart Manufacturing's current competitive advantages and production expertise. Further, new product lines are expected to decrease seasonality that has been experienced historically.

Deploy advanced management information systems - Zindart is enhancing manufacturing and business processes through the deployment of advanced management information systems that enable the real-time monitoring and management of its operating and financial performance and resources.
