Our sole mission is to fully automate the entire waste collection workflow, replacing paper-based scheduling, dispatching, and collection methods with easy-to-use electronic tools in the office and in the truck. The products and services that we sell are a direct result of the input we have received from our ten-plus years of experience modeling the collection, transportation, and disposal of trash.   Managing routes--residential, commercial, or roll-off--is a dynamic, fluid process. Route changes, driver issues, run backs, and truck maintenance issues all compete for your attention. Traditionally, waste haulers have managed this challenging workload with paper, multiple dispatch sites, and expensive radio and cell phone communications. At Routeware, we've pioneered a system that automates all of that. Route adjustments, truck locations, and pick-up/drop-off activity are now communicated automatically between the truck and the office. Your trucks become rich data collectors, feeding everything they're doing back to the office in real-time. Using Routeware's powerful reporting tools, everyone in the office can see exactly what's unfolding on every route. This kind of visibility leads to cost savings, route consolidation, better driver management, reduction of paperwork, and increased revenue.   From product engineering to sales and marketing, everything we do is focused on our customers--not only those who use our products but the tens of thousands of homes and businesses our hauling partners service every day. We understand that hauling is a mission-critical, 24/7 business, with the absolute need to pick up 100% of the trash 100% of the time. To do that, haulers need tools that let them see and manage everything that's going on with their drivers and trucks...and connect it with everything that's happening in the office. That's what we do; provide you with the means to transform your hauling operation into a lean competitive business.   If these things are important to you--strengthening the driver/management relationship, increasing accountability, reducing costs, and improving the efficiency of your organization--give us a call. Let's start a conversation about how we can put the power of Routeware to work for you."

ROMAD's patented Malware Genetic Sequencing™ technology enables us to identify, analyze, and stop in real time entire viral ""families"", as opposed to specific strains or individual variants. This ability allows reliable, sustained detection and diffusion of a wide range of malware threats. We detect what OTHERS MISS – because we’re not stuck in the perpetual arms race with malware developers, passively looking for their next creation just to figure out how to catch it next time. We detect BEFORE others can – because we’re not waiting to analyze the new variant as a prerequisite to detection.  Derivative strains and variants are just that - derivative. Our patent-pending family-based detection profiles let us cover the vast majority of derivatives on-the-fly. We detect with the LEAST AMOUNT OF OVERHEAD, both on our team and on your endpoint – because unlike legacy platforms, we don’t need millions of individual static signatures to match the hundreds of thousands of derivative strains and variants created every day. We detect WHERE others cannot – our Malware Genetics™ and dynamic threat response technology allows ROMAD to sustain detection capability virtually in perpetuity. Isolated industrial deployment scenarios such as SCADA, ICS, and IoT environments where updates are infrequent, yet viral threats prevalent (think Stuxnet model), are a perfect place for ROMAD endpoint threat detection and response capabilities. We DISRUPT the criminal malware economic model by eliminating the critical time-to-detection gap – the opportunity to monetize the malware before detection is developed by legacy static-signature platforms. We eliminate the economic incentive for malware writers, kit builders, and bot herders, thereby contributing to the elimination of the vast majority of profit-driven malware presently in the wild. Legacy anti-virus companies, dominated by outdated thinking and outmoded malware detection methods, chase their tales as they keep growing their analyst teams and bloating their signature sets into the hundreds of millions. Then there’s ROMAD: an elegant, truly innovative, and uniquely capable platform specifically designed from the ground-up to address the actual root cause of the malware epidemic – the criminal malware economic model."

From our founder Bill Larson’s first little Round Table Pizza Parlor in Menlo Park, California in 1959 to 450 thriving restaurants today, Round Table has always stood for freshness, innovation and craveable flavors in everything we serve. Most pizza chains use primarily frozen dough, and often skimp on both the quality and quantity of their toppings and ingredients to cut costs. Not at Round Table. We roll our dough fresh, from scratch, every day, in every restaurant. That dough is made from wheat grown for us on family farms in Idaho. Our cheddar cheese is aged to perfection, and combined with whole milk mozzarella and provolone in our famous three–cheese blend. We use only premium meats for our toppings, which we spread lavishly on every pizza, all the way to the edge of the crust. And our vegetable toppings are freshly cut at each restaurant, including our juicy, selectively–picked tomatoes. This commitment to quality and authenticity is why we say we’re “The Last Honest Pizza.” While we’re proud of the ingredients we use, Round Table is more than just freshness and quality. We’re the place where you’ll find unique, innovative pizza creations that expertly combine flavors no one else can match. Over the years we’ve introduced more than 30 successful new products, including many that are mainstays of our menu today. There’s the legendary King Arthur’s Supreme, with pepperoni, Italian sausage, Italian dry salami, linguica, mushrooms, green peppers, yellow onions, black olives, three cheeses and our Zesty Red Sauce. And the Wombo Combo, featuring primo pepperoni, linguica, Italian sausage, crisp bacon, mushrooms, Roma tomatoes, artichoke hearts and green onions. There are many more delightful combinations to choose from, or you can select your crust, sauce and toppings and create your own masterpiece. With appetizers like our Garlic Parmesan Twists, and salad bars offering an array of fresh selections, Round Table presents a feast of flavors that bring our guests back again and again, whether they choose to dine in, carry out or have us deliver. There are a lot of places that serve pizza.
