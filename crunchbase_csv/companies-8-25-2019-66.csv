PROBLEM|OPPORTUNITY Current Challenge: Moms are overwhelmed with the sheer volume of products available to them so they rely on trusted recommendations to buy their products. The companies, on the other hand, spend a lot of time and effort trying to capture the attention of the busy mom. SOLUTION|PRODUCT  A platform that connects moms to their products through storytelling. Our unique way of selling speaks from a viewpoint of moms for moms without having to advertise. Therefore, the content the moms choose to read will seamlessly provide matching products so they can buy it on the platform. BUSINESS MODEL The moms around the world access the marketplace for free and the brands pay to market and sell to their desired audience (based on location and interests). Brands select campaigns to market their products to boost recommendations and pay a monthly fee to manage their inventory. COMPETITORS and DIFFERENTIATION Competitors include other mom networks like smilemom.com, content providers like babble.com as well as generic event apps. Our differentiation is we market through storytelling written by moms and connect brands through campaigns and events all in one. TECHNOLOGY and SCALABILITY The technology is the web platform that connects with moms around the world with a smartphone. This enables us to provide user-centric content desired by the audience based on their interests and location. This also allows multiple campaigns and localized sales to be run concurrently for the desired location. The site currently has a reach in 6 countries and can reach out worldwide to tap a market that is worth $12 trillion. EXECUTION PLAN|GO TO MARKET STRATEGY We are currently live and operating post-revenue and our strategy is to make this a platform available to any brand that needs to sell to moms around the world based on interest and location. We want to build a community-driven marketplace for moms that leverages the existing readers and allow vendors to manage their own inventory of products and target their desired audience by interest and location. Our platform would ultimately combine the power of moms' reviews with e-commerce that will facilitate the type of products and services that moms get to buy based on recommendations."
