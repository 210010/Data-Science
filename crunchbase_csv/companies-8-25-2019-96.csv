Soft Robotics Inc.,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/soft-robotics-inc-,"Advanced Materials, Industrial Automation, Robotics",Soft Robotics opens new markets to automation through the application and commercialization of its proprietary soft robotics technology.,"The business end of a robotic arm is the gripper. The March 2105 edition of Modern Materials Handling best describes the challenge when they wrote:  “Perhaps more than any other element of robotic development in warehousing and distribution, the end-of-arm tooling, or gripper, is the place that can make or break a robot’s success.”  Advancing gripper technology is the key to unlocking a new age of automation. An age where they can automate tote pick and pack for grocery distribution, bin picking of soft and delicate parts, e-commerce order fulfillment, fruit harvesting, luggage handling, and consumer goods packaging. The US fresh produce packing market alone represents a $27 billion retail market searching for automation solutions. Soft Robotics has demonstrated the ability to bring robotic product handling and packaging to this market.  These are problems of adaptability, complexity, and cost. The search for a more adaptable gripper has driven up the complexity of design to devices like servo grippers and complicated tool changing requirements. This complexity comes at a high price in gripper cost, the need for larger arms, and complex software and hardware integration.  Their revolutionary soft robotic technology, covered by more than 40 patents and applications, enables us to design and manufacture soft robotic hands that address the new unstructured world of automation and logistics.  Through their propriety knowledge of actuator geometry, material selection, and operating envelope, they can tune actuators to be force limiting with NO CLOSED LOOP FEEDBACK system required. Soft Robotics brings the highest level of adaptability, while lowering system complexity and total system cost. The adaptive nature of their technology allows a single grasper to handle an unprecedented range of objects, regardless of shape, size, or weight, with no tool or software changes between cycles.  We’ve demonstrated the ability to grasp bags of rice, raw food, bars of soap, boxes of toothpaste, and clothing all with a single device.  But soft does not mean weak. Their technology has the ability to scale from the smallest to the largest task. The result is an automation solution that can pack a tote for retail distribution, pick fruit off the vine, or easily handle a ten pound kettle bell.  They have demonstrated the speed and precision necessary to integrate into the factories and warehouses of today and the future, operating at speeds up to 130 picks per minute.Their system is plug and play with the most common industrial robots using industry standard protocols and vision systems.They have designed the system to be “robot and vision agnostic,” allowing the system to quickly and seamlessly integrate with the full range of robots, from small collaborative systems to high speed industrial packing cells.  Soft Robotics launched their industrial product at Automate 2015 in March 2015, Their produce handling system in June 2015, and started shipping in June 2015. They are now selling systems to their pilot customers. Soft Robotics is foundational technology that solves the problems of today and unlocks the future of automation."

Daily national news stories remind of us all of how kids are bombarded by bullying, profanity, nudity, sexting and more on their smartphones. The list of internet threats to teens and tweens only continues to grow. Instant access to Cyberspace via smartphones has dramatically changed parenting, and parents worry and wonder what they can do about these complex problems. In response to these threats, a couple of dads who saw their teens engulfed by their smartphones for hours every day said “enough is enough”. They set out to develop an app that is so technically advanced that it can lean forward into the swarm of new teen apps coming at kids at an ever-increasing accelerated pace on the internet. Social Judo was born, the app that uses the power of the internet against the power of the internet. This app shows what current content is on a child’s phone, analyzes it, and reports back to a parent if there is concerning content or even possibe danger. This new app uses artificial intelligence (AI) to Help Social Judo scour the internet and identify new dangers and threats. The AI component of Social Judo then brings that information back to the development team with ideas and suggestions on how to protect your kid from the dangers of these new apps without spying on them.  Dr. Matt Philips, a brain surgeon and visionary behind the development of this new app said; “I want to help establish the paradigm of parenting children in Cyberspace. We parent at home, we parent on the playing fields, we parent at school, but in the one space our kids spend 5-6 hours per day, goes unparented and virtually unsupervised. “It’s not your child that you need to be concerned about”, continues Philips. He notes it can be the other kids your child interfaces with daily. All it takes is one kid showing your child porn, or nudity, or explaining sex without love, and, once that has happened, you can’t take it back, you can’t un-see it. In most cases, you’re not even aware this has happened. Getting an alert sent to a parent’s phone that your child has been looking at or has been sent these kinds of messages or images is what Social Judo accomplishes, Dr. Philips calls it a “parenting moment”. From the parent’s app on a smartphone, they can lock a child’s phone, making it impossible to continue to be bullied or sent this kind of material. If you’re interested in talking about cyber bullying, the neuroscience behind smartphone addiction, teen suicide or “death by smartphone”, and a whole host of other subjects, then Dr. Philips, the new national expert on these subjects, would love to chat with you. Like himself, he wants other parents to be aware of the dangers of smartphone use and abuse that our children are being exposed to every day. Send us an email to “admin@socialjudo.com”"

PROs charge businesses general blanket license fees that offer the ability to use all music from a catalog. With some PRO's catalogs containing millions of songs, it is impossible for a business to use all music they are paying for. This is an inefficient and antiquated process. This fee structure is also unlike radio and TV, which only pay for the actual music they use. Soundstr's technology allows businesses to identify all music used and negotiate per-use license fees. Our technology also helps songwriters receive compensation when their music is performed or broadcast in a commercial setting. This same patent-pending technology offers the ability for businesses to generate more advertising revenue.

Sookbox,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sookbox,"Cloud Computing, Content, Music, Software, Video",Sookbox is a cross-platform that enables users to virtually connect and control media from a handheld device.,"Sookbox provides a universal framework to connect and control media on all devices.  The goal of Sookbox is to empower users to enjoy their media on whatever device they choose, from the palm of their hand. At Sookbox, media access is organized by user, rather than by device or service. Devices should do what they are best at doing. Movies should be watched on a television, not a laptop. Music should be listened to through an amp and speakers, not computer speakers. And the remote control for everything should be a smartphone or tablet. The problem is that communication between these media outlets is difficult and onerous. Sookbox gives a cross-platform universal solution that goes beyond putting a smart app on a smart TV. Sookbox breaks from traditional thinking in two crucial ways: First is to put a cloud into homes, and the second is to serve content and controls separately. Sookbox provides a novel type of cloud service. The Sookbox uses stored or streamed content. It allows users to have their own physical server in their homes. This server, the Sookbox, allows a user to store content in their own ""personal cloud."" That is music, digital movies, and pictures on a single server. This idea is not unique, but it is powerfully packaged: media storage, distribution, and control - all centralized and layered in a single device. That gives you the power to use your iPhone to click “Goodfellas. Basement TV.” The core of the product line, the software of the cloud server, is a revolutionary type of web application development platform known as Harmony.  The current paradigm is a world where content and controls are in the same place. For example, the YouTube video controls are right next to the video and the back button is across the browser. Sookbox transcends that paradigm. Televisions are best for video, speakers are best for sound, and handheld devices are best for control. Now that Sookbox divides the cloud by user, it makes sense to serve multiple, different sites from a single web app. A fundamental Sookbox feature is that it does not compete with other cloud services or try to debunk them. Instead, it gives them a platform and a vessel to reach their current users in a friendlier, more powerful way. Harmony unleashes applications such as Pandora, Netflix and YouTube across a user’s home. For example, someone might want to develop a “Pandora Alarm Clock” app. The API allows developers to provide a single, connective user experience synchronized across multiple types of devices. On the developers' side, the Harmony libraries and structure allow them to serve independently content to content device(s) and controls to controlling device(s). By facilitating this two-way communication, Sookbox allows the navigation of media, the play/pause, volume, etc. to be displayed graphically on the handheld device and directly control the music coming out of the speakers. Sookbox can be viewed as a personal cloud. Personal meaning the user owns it personally, but also it is personalized. The cloud should be divided by user, not by device or by service. Sookbox opens a new layer between the other cloud services and the user that makes the experience personal and meaningful."
