Homeis,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/homeis,"Communities, Private Social Networking, Social Network",Homeis develops a software platform that builds a better Internet for immigrants.,"We’ve created Homeis because we know first hand how deep the experience of being foreign-born is. When you ask us what home is, we don’t have an easy answer. It’s complicated. We have the city we chose to live in and call home, and then we have our culture, the country we come from, which we call home as well. And it’s a big part of our identity, it’s who we are. Homeis was created to help people like us, who belong here and there, and feel that the Internet is undeserving them. We’ve witnessed how difficult it is for local foreign-born communities to digitally connect, share their culture, their local knowledge, and unique context. We saw how important these communities are in one’s life, how supportive they can be, and how effective their common wisdom can be to its members. So we decided it’s time to give foreign-born communities a dedicated comprehensive product. A product that understands them really well, and most importantly - empowers them. It’s what we’re here for. While local culture networks have always existed, our mission is to use technology and innovation to turn these invisible groups into visible communities. Homeis was founded in Feb 2017 in NYC and Tel Aviv. We’ve launched our first community in Dec 2017, and are planning to open many more in the next months. As most foreign-born people, we are BIG dreamers. Join us!"

In 2017, Mr. Xu Hongjun, co-founder and former vice president of Mobike, who had been in charge of hardware developing and manufacturing, founded Hongji Bike. His entrepreneur partner includes Mr. Wang Chao, designer of the classic Mobike model and founder of Kaiyun Motors. After Mobike was acquired by Meituan, most engineers from the Wuxi hardware team also joined Hongji Bike. At the China Cycle 2019, the largest bicycle fair in China that will be held in Shanghai this May, Hongji Bike will showcase its overall solutions for shared-mobility and custom-made / high-end bikes for both corporate customers and individual consumers, along with a gold prize-winning bike model at this fair. As Mobike and OFO quickly blossomed in China and across the globe, new competitors from other parts of the world have entered the market. The solution that Hongji Bike is going to display at the fair has been proved effective through our cooperation with many shared mobility startup companies worldwide. In May 2018, Hongji Bike received an order of 40,000 E-scooters from Lime, a shared mobility company based in North America. In around a month, Hongji Bike finished design, modeling, production and exportation, tackling Lime's urgent need of supply. After the Lime project, Hongji Bike broke the ice and attracted various shared mobility operators, to become its new customers, providing them with E-scooter, E-Bike and traditional shaft-driven bicycles. Xu Hongjun believes that Hongji possesses the capability to develop motors and control system, and is able to independently develop and manufacture system control units. It can deliver products with an appropriate and flexible cost under the rigorous requirements of the shared mobility market. Also, Hongji Bike is an expert in mass-production with its own factories and sophisticated supply system, able to react quickly to buyers' needs. Furthermore, Hongji Bike is engaged in exporting solutions for multiple shared mobility scenarios including in-park transportation, as well as providing services in product design, engineering technologies and manufacturing. And in the future, it is going to launch high-end bikes targeted at the European consumer market. SOURCE Hongji Bike"

And vice versa, booking sites without direct contracts, purchasing rooms through third party vendors such as bed banks and wholesalers, have no direct access to accurate hotel data and content that goes beyond pricing and availability.  Hotel Data Cloud helps hotels win back control of the descriptive content of their listings by establishing a globally consistent standard with automated distribution to all channels. We provide a central database that houses a hotel’s descriptions and photos, plus many additional data points. Hotels can simply update and publish this information to any booking site - instantly. The standardized data feed even lets hoteliers push temporary changes, such us undergoing renovations. And any booking partner, whether directly contracted or through third parties, can access these data sets for free. The comprehensive data sets capture not only descriptions, but also amenities, services and features of the rooms – ranging from parking options to details like “Does the safe fit a 15 inch laptop”. And the database does not simply host photos – they can be attributed to certain room types, so guests know what to expect and there are no surprises and frustration after checking in. Plus, HDC offers human translation for all texts to help hotels reach even wider markets. HDC supplies this unaltered information to booking websites, allowing them to provide much better hotel information before a booking is created. They can fine-tune their hotel search functions with better filter options, allowing customers to make smarter booking decisions. But most importantly, a majority of customer support calls become redundant – neither booking platforms nor hotels will have to repeatedly answer superficial questions like “How much does breakfast cost”. The increased capacity of travel agents and hotel staff lets them help their customers/guests with issues that really do require personal attention.

Honest Tea,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/honest-tea,"Consumer Goods, Food and Beverage, Organic, Tea","Honest Tea seeks to create and promote great-tasting, organic beverages.","Seth Goldman, co-founder of Honest Tea, drank a lot of liquids. An active person, Seth was continually in search of the perfect drink to quench his thirst after a run, a game of basketball or between grad school classes. Yet, Seth found most drinks either too sweet or too tasteless. Barry Nalebuff, Seth’s professor at the Yale School of Management, found that he and Seth shared a passion for the idea of a less sweet, but flavorful beverage during a class discussion of a Coke vs. Pepsi case study. They agreed that there were tons of sweet options and lots of watery drinks, but in 1994, there was nothing in between to fill the void. Fast forward to ’97. Seth goes for a run in New York City with a college friend who used to concoct juice drinks with him after class. As they found themselves doing the same beverage mixing after the run, Seth knew then that if he was going to quench his thirst for good, he would have to create the drink himself. He e-mailed Barry to see if he was still excited about the idea. Timing was everything. Barry had just returned from India where he had been analyzing the tea industry for a case study. Among other things, he came away with the impression that the tea many American companies purchased for bottling was the dust and fannings left after whole tea leaves had been brewed. Barry had even come up with a name to describe a bottled tea that was made with real tea leaves–Honest Tea. When Seth heard the name, the simmering idea began to boil–it was the perfect name for an all-natural brand that would strive to create healthy and honest relationships with its customers, suppliers and the environment. Seth took a deep breath, quit his job at Calvert mutual funds, and started brewing batches of tea in his kitchen. Five weeks after taking the plunge, he brought thermoses of tea and a recycled bottle with a mock-up label to Fresh Fields (Whole Foods Market). The buyer ordered 15,000 bottles, and Seth and Barry were in business–if they could figure out how to make that much tea. They did, and they’re still at it 15 years later. In March 2011, The Coca-Cola Company purchased Honest Tea after an initial 40% investment in 2008, which helped expand the distribution of HONEST® beverages.  Today, Honest Tea is run as an independent business unit and their HONEST TEA®, HONEST ADE®, HONEST KIDS®, HONEST SPLASH™ and HONEST Fizz beverages can be found in more than 100,000 stores across United States.  The dream that took root in Seth’s kitchen in 1998 became a company that just celebrated its 15th anniversary.  Seth continues to run the business as the President and TeaEO in Bethesda, MD with the same passion towards health, the environment and social responsibility."
