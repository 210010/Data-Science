Our focus is capital markets; we work with firms that have the ambition to reinvent the industry's business models. Our technology is p2p network platforms and protocol first - protocol suite, software that implements those protocols and provides client software and infrastructure for p2p networks. Its based on Ethereum and we call it Autonity - the protocol, the Geth-based client. We use our technology to build p2p networks and dFMI. P2p networks are private, member-owned and governed networks that enable peer-to-peer transfer of financial value and automation of contractual and fiduciary operations without reliance on trusted third-parties. Such decentralised networks can interact with one another, creating a wider ecosystem of value and leveraging the network effect, and they can form part of a dFMI. dFMI is a new concept, one that builds on the security and resilience guarantees of distributed ledger and systems engineering to provide a platform for tokenising value and transferring its ownership between participants on that or, by cross-platform exchange, on other platforms. We believe that our technology will drive adoption of a next-generation dFMI where intermediaries are removed, incentive structures encourage self-regulation, and risks are mitigated and reduced to the maximum. dFMI doesn't just provide a cryptographically secure environment for market participants to transact, it provides a peer-to-peer model that removes financial intermediaries and engenders a wider ecosystem for value transfer across platforms and pre- post-trade processes. dFMI works to mitigate concentration and liquidity risk, reduce settlement cycles to real-time, remove friction, and lower the transaction cost of economic exchange.

There is a growing demand for accommodation globally and that's particularly obvious in most city hotels who are often fully booked. Managing the existing inventory and maximizing the profit is a key challenge of small hotel chains today since technology has had limited impact. From the software stack perspective a hotel typically should use three types of software (PMS + Channel Manager + RMS) and we understood that for hotels that have the need to optimize their revenue it's impossible without data driven software. We understood as well that there is a big gap in the hotel space since small hotel chains don't have access to accessible Revenue Management Systems. Due to the lack of financial capacity and know-how on how to use the current complex and expensive Revenue management systems on the market, small hotel chains end up doing daily analysis on spreadsheets that are both time-consuming and information-poor resulting in making decisions that leave hotels running below their full revenue potential.

The company has been built firmly on the premise that e-invoicing should be free, easy-to-use and non-disruptive – only then will suppliers move away from paper.  These principles underpin the CloudTrade service. With most e-invoice, e-trading and EDI service providers, technical, process and commercial barriers often impact the success of supplier adoption. As a result, paper remains and the expected benefits fail to materialise. CloudTrade's patent pending technology allows us to take a different, non-intrusive approach, that guarantees high supplier adoption. We do not require a supplier to download any software.  We do not require a supplier to change their billing application or infrastructure to send EDI or XML. We do not require a supplier to change their processes and log onto 3rd party portals.  We simply take advantage of tools every supplier already uses.   If a supplier can simply email a PDF invoice they can be an e-invoice supplier. Our technology maps the data (no OCR) embedded within the PDF (or any other data document) into an e-invoice data structure.  As we act on the data placed there by the original generating application (e.g. accounting system ), our service is akin to mapping one flavour of XML to another. As a result of this non-intrusive approach, more suppliers are moved onto e-invoicing (and in a shorter time frame) than any other EDI or e-invoicing approach."

Using patent-pending methods, CloudMask, running on user devices, transparently intercepts and analyses data to identify, tokenize, and encrypt sensitive information. The intercepted data may belong to a variety of applications, such as Google, SalesForce, Box, and MS Office 365 and practically any other application you could be using.  CloudMask converts your sensitive data to tokens that have the same structure as the original data but are meaningless, jumbled texts bearing no relation to the original data. As a result, the application receives meaningless tokens, instead of the original private data.  These tokens do not break the application’s functionality, nor can it be broken by any cryptanalysis. Accordingly, the application continues to function as before and security is transparent, without requiring any changes to existing applications. CloudMask protects you against unauthorized disclosure and vendor misuse of the data as well.  These techniques also apply to on-premise applications, and accordingly CloudMask mitigates insider threats by utilizing user-owned keys (asymmetric key pair). These keys are never shared or transmitted over the network. Only users/systems explicitly authorized by the data owner may use their personal keys to restore tokens back to their meaningful data. One of the biggest competitive advantage of CloudMask is its scalability. This is needed not only to address the top of the pyramid, such as governments and large enterprise. But it is also very important when offering a cloud service to potentially millions of users, and even more devices. CloudMask is a Common Criteria certified. Common Criteria is a global security certification that approved by 26 governments, demonstrating that the user data remains private even if the network, application and CloudMask servers are fully compromised. Now to complete the picture, our long term vision is to expand the model to cover Internet of Things devices. In other words there is no reason to limit our space to end-user, we want to protect private information no matter where their being created."

The tin-117m based products have been developed under the Initiative for Proliferation Prevention (IPP) program in collaboration with the US Department of Energy and Brookhaven National Laboratory initially using reactors in Russia.  This early work validated the imaging and therapeutic effects predicted for tin-117m.   Under this IPP program a proton accelerator method of producing the tin-117m at higher specific activities was then developed in collaboration with the Institute for Nuclear Research near to Moscow.  This production method has been demonstrated to be transferable to a number of institutions in the USA and elsewhere where the product could be made at will.   Innovative work by Dr. Nigel Stevenson led to a new tin-117m production method using alpha particles and a cadmium-116 target.  This is now the primary method that is routinely used to manufacture the tin for the clinical trial product.    In conjunction with this, the development of our primary product, Tin-Annexin, has led to numerous pre-clinical and clinical trials that have demonstrated the viability of not only imaging the vulnerable plaque but, more importantly, therapeutically treating the condition."
