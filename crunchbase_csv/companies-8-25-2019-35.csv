Because of its long history, staying power, and public trust, the Good News Network has remained #1 on Google. From the beginning, it was a clearinghouse for the gathering and dissemination of positive news stories from around the globe. Since 2006 their daily dose of ‘News to Enthuse’ has confirmed for thousands of fans what they already knew to be true — that good news itself is not in short supply; the broadcasting of it is. Thomas Jefferson said the job of journalists was to portray accurately what was happening in society. The Good News Network was founded because the media was failing to report on the positive. In the 1990’s while homicide rates in the U.S. plummeted by 42 percent, television news coverage of murders surged more than 700 percent, according to the Center for Media and Public Affairs.

The application also offers in-store location based marketing and mobile payment offerings to these retailers. The modern merchant increasingly faces challenges in “digitizing” their customer base, and Gofindo provides an affordable solution to drive user engagement and present opportunities for the merchants themselves. “Brands that upped their spend on customer retention over the past one to three years drove a 200% higher chance of growing their market share.” Forbes increasing challenges for retailers   Sixty-seven percent of users say they would not recommend a business with a poorly designed mobile experience. Retailers are increasingly facing competition from online based ecommerce retailers who are seeking to disrupt the traditional brick & mortar retail space. While online commerce continues to be a growing segment focus, it does not represent most of sales, as a large number of legacy businesses still rely on consistent traffic through a physical location. However, this does not mean that these retailers are immune from changes. Mall foot traffic has continued to decline and traditional brick and mortar retailers are struggling to find ways that capture and retain consumers moving through their physical operations into a digital capacity. To address these concerns Gofindo: Provides a seamless omni-channel experience to end users while collecting actionable data and insights Enables mobile payment options and transactions, reducing merchant’s credit card fees Reduces marketing effort and spend needed to manage offers via traditional online marketing Eliminates the need for retailers to invest significantly in their own standalone mobile application Dashboard and analysis of collected purchase and marketing data provides insight and opportunity for a retailer to increase their store’s revenue potential The Gofindo Solution Gofindo enables business to easily build tailor-made mobile engagement programs to connect and reward a merchant’s customers in a personal and efficient manner.

As a cloud-based point of sale technology, Gofindo provides a low risk and affordable entry cost, while still representing a fully-featured solution which can be used by retailers to improve revenue and traffic at their location. The platform’s key solution is represented by the ability of consumers to use a “white”-labelled mobile application, which when combined with key loyalty features and discounts provided by the retailer fulfills both merchant and consumer needs. When used by a retailer, usage and purchase information (such as by the Gofindo mobile payment technology), will enable invaluable insights that enable the merchant to create more refined future marketing offers. For the consumer, offers and loyalty points increase engagement and drive more consistent incentivizing purchasing behaviors. Future Opportunities In addition to the initial roll-out and service offering provided by Gofindo to retailers and merchants, future offerings represent significant opportunities not only for continued scalability of Gofindo, as a way to complement the suite of solutions Gofindo directly provides. This is represented by the combination of potential mobile wallet and blockchain solutions, used by consumers and retailers, to incentivize both groups for a fully-engaged retail shopping experience leading to compounding growth potential for the organization. Service Offering & Business Model Gofindo’s primary service offering is represented by the cloud-based Software as a Service offering for retailers, providing multiple key benefits.
