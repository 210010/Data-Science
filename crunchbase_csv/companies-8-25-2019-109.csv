Drone delivery will heavily reduce shipping costs, minimize pollution, decrease road congestion and significantly increase customer convenience. To reach a meaningful scale, drones need a standardized, safe, and secure place to land. Valqari’s solution is the Smart Drone Delivery Mailbox, or commonly referred to as a RCVR-PAD (Remote Communicating Vault Receiver - Personal Automated Delivery). Valqari’s patented RCVR-PAD serves as a designated area for drones to safely land, protecting people, pets, and property from being harmed. The RCVR-PAD’s vault system can secure multiple packages and can only be opened by authorized users. The RCVR-PAD will replace existing, free-standing mailboxes in suburban areas and our window-mounted model can be incorporated in both urban and suburban areas. Our RCVR-PAD uses two-way communication so a drone can verify that it has landed at the correct location and RCVR-PAD can verify the right drone has landed with the correct package. Once dual-verification has taken place, the RCVR-PAD’s security door slides open to accept the delivery and closes once the delivery is complete. The end-user receives a notification of the status of their package delivery and can retrieve the package at their convenience.  Valqari’s IP protection strategy will allow us to prevent imitators from capturing market share domestically and internationally.

Valor Capital Partners,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/valor-capital-partners,Medical,"The Company’s primary purpose is providing operating capital, directly or indirectly, to one or more companies engaged.","2% monthly (24% annual) yield on a secured, 24-month promissory note. The Company’s primary purpose is providing operating capital, directly or indirectly, to one or more companies engaged in the business of pre-qualifying potential plaintiffs in mass tort personal injury cases. In contrast to the “typical” litigation funding scenario, a few funding companies have begun to focus on funding cases arising out of large-scale claims involving personal injuries attributable to defective medical products or pharmaceuticals - otherwise known as “mass tort"""" claims. Mass torts are considered to provide a cost-effective alternative to lengthy and expensive traditional single-party litigation. These cases usually involve large corporate defendants, such as pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, that have already been found liable (or have conceded liability) with respect to a defective or harmful product. In most of such cases, the defendant establishes a settlement fund, to be administered by the court, and from which qualified claimants will be paid. In such cases, a plaintiff generally only needs to show (i) that his/her damages were caused by the defective product, and (ii) the extent of such damages. When a prospective plaintiff is identified, the plaintiff undergoes a thorough screening (that can include interviews, detailed reviews of medical records, an independent medical examination and, if necessary, revisionary surgery) to determine that such plaintiff has a valid and viable claim for recovery. Once a plaintiff is qualified, he/she is referred to an experienced attorney who files a case, negotiates a settlement and obtains a financial recovery.     • The mass tort process dates back to the 1960’s (not a new concept)  • There exists NO market or traditional sector correlation or interest rate risk for this  investment  • This is not Litigation Funding. We DO NOT provide funding to Law Firms or Plaintiffs."

Professional networking can be as easy as swiping right. Valor Connect is a new mobile app applying the same principles of the most successful dating apps -- the swipe feature from Tinder, the compatibility algorithms from eHarmony -- to make finding and connecting with professionals you don’t yet know, but probably should, easier and more efficient than ever before.  Valor Connect is the ideal networking solution for whatever your goals are: - Consultants looking for business - Recruiters looking for candidates - Job seekers looking for opportunities - Students looking for mentors - Entrepreneurs looking for partners - Professionals looking to find industry experts - Individuals trying to expand their horizons Who you know often matters more than what you know -- it’s true. That’s precisely why networking is so crucial in building a career. But there’s an inherent problem with this system: the traditional networking process is awkward, time-consuming, and inefficient. People often fall short of their full potential because they can’t find the RIGHT people to connect with to locate the RIGHT opportunities for them. Networking at events is particularly challenging, and meeting interesting people is often a crapshoot. In addition to general networking, the other primary market for Valor Connect is conferences and events. Valor Connect provides an enhanced way for attendees to make valuable connections before, during and after events - all while also helping event organizers obtain potent metrics to really understand and know their attendees goals and interests.  Whether you are trying to identify the right people at an event, find an alumni mentor, or network with people in your organization, Valor Connect has made the process of finding inspiring people incredibly simple: 1. Log in with your LinkedIn or Facebook account.  2. Tap your professional and personal interests from a wall of tags.  3. Sit back and let our algorithm do all the work for you 4. Review your new curated stack of profile cards each day -- swipe right if you agree that they’d be a good person to meet, left if not.  5. Once both parties swipe yes, start messaging your new connection in-app.  At first glance, it may seem like Valor Connect is going head-to-head against LinkedIn, but the two actually form a symbiotic relationship. Valor Connect is not a competitor to LinkedIn; Valor Connect is a precursor to LinkedIn. LinkedIn is useful for storing your existing professional connections. The process is typically: meet someone in person at an event, through a connection, etc., and then connect on LinkedIn. The process on Valor is the opposite: meet on Valor, then connect in person at an event, conference, over the phone, email etc., and ultimately connect on LinkedIn. Meet on Valor, then connect on LinkedIn."

MagnetoJet’s extraordinary physics are accomplished by depositing Aluminum wire into an 800°C ceramic chamber, where it is influenced by a molten state. This molten media is then electromagnetically pulsed – causing a droplet to form and eject with precision from a carefully crafted ceramic nozzle. The Mk 1 delivers 1000 droplets per second with micron-level accuracy while doubling the speed of conventional 3D powder bed metal printers. Aluminum was an intentional first step, but MagnetoJet will evolve to printing additional conductive metals and potentially thousands of printing heads within one machine.

With the birth of Americas Best Value Inn, he did just that, but never foresaw the industry-leading trendsetter that would quickly evolve.  Today, Vantage Hospitality Group is a full-service hospitality company that, directly or through its affiliates and subsidiaries, offers hoteliers the choice of five brands, covering the budget through upscale markets; hotel management; real estate and hotel brokerage services; and a hotel-focused insurance agency.  Throughout its expansion, Vantage has remained true to Roger's mission. Answering to its members, not to Wall Street, has allowed Vantage to continue to provide its brand members low fees and straightforward contracts, brand standards with a purpose, and A Voice and A Vote in their brand's direction. Vantage's Freestyle® model has become a hallmark of the hospitality industry, allowing hotel owners the best of both worlds - the resources of a hotel franchise and the freedom of a membership, ensuring that brand members are truly ""In Business for Themselves, Not by Themselves.""  As the company has grown, so, too, has the need to extend the Vantage philosophy beyond the economy segment. Vantage first answered with the Lexington by Vantage brand, positioned in the upscale market, and in January 2015, Vantage acquired the America's Best Inns & Suites, Country Hearth Inn & Suites, and Jameson Inn brands, and acquired and re-launched the Signature Inn brand. All new members of these brands will enjoy the same robust platform of resources that every owner should expect from its brand, while maintaining greater autonomy and more of their hard-earned money.  Roger Bloss, the longest-tenured CEO of a hotel branding company, has steered the company from its inception. He and partner Bernie Moyle (COO & CFO) are as accessible to their members as ever and are as eager to speak with the owner of a 40-room budget property as with the managing director of a publicly-traded REIT that owns a 300-room upscale hotel."
