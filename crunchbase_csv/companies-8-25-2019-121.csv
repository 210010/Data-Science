Yesware’s Reports and Analytics give salespeople unprecedented feedback about how their messages are being received.  This is not new technology. They are focused on optimizing proven technology to meet the needs of power users - people who get and send 100 or more emails a day, people who want computers to take on more data-entry and more automation, so that users can focus on building relationships and closing more business. The company's initial target market for B2B salespeople. For these people, a productivity tool that can help them reach their sales goals is extremely valuable. Yesware offers 100 free tracking emails per month to start and you can earn up to 100 additional emails for referring friends, or upgrade to a Plus account with unlimited email tracking. The company also offers Team, Enterprise, and Custom product plans. Learn more at www.yesware.com/plans-and-pricing.

When combined with the grid, they will create a hybrid power system that is cheaper, more reliable and much “greener” than the grid alone. YouSolar has the technology and business model to accelerate this transformation. Their first market is India, a country with acute power shortages that is emerging as the largest market for solar+battery systems. If you regularly need backup power and have roof space, YouSolar can provide a complete energy solution at much lower cost than electricity from a diesel generator. You will have reliable, high quality electricity with no switchover during grid outages and plenty of power when turning on appliances. Best of all, they will monitor your system 24/7 and back it up with a 5-year warranty. The worldwide market for solar systems is poised to grow exponentially. India is the hotspot. In July 2015 India announced a goal of 40 GW of power from rooftop solar by 2022 (equivalent to 10 million systems). However, two big challenges must be overcome: How to integrate these systems with the grid, and how to finance them. YouSolar’s solar+battery systems and secure leasing model are the answers. Thanks to this proprietary intelligence, the YouSolar system uses nearly all the solar energy generated by the solar array and, thus, does not have to be “net metered”. The system takes power from the grid, but never sends power to the grid. So, there is no need to get a permit from the utility. YouSolar’s system can remain functioning at all times, unlike net metered systems which must shut down during power cuts (for safety). Being available during power cuts and requiring no permits are big advantages in markets like India."

Yumber,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/yumber,"File Sharing, Internet, Video, Web Apps",Yumber develops word-of-mouth technology solutions for users to create their own verbal resource locators.,"Imagine navigating the Internet the way you talk. Instead of long difficult to share URLs, what if you could navigate the web by simply inputting a word or phrase without the for https, .coms, or /'s. What if you could verbally share URLs & more? Yumber is empowering people to create their own VRLs (verbal resource locators) which serve as simple verbal pathways to information that is difficult to remember and share. Instead of having to share difficult information through email, social media, or print, with this new technology you can share complex information verbally with ease. These VRLs, or as they are called, Yumbers, allow you to share hard to remember information such as physical addresses, phone numbers, URLs, etc. by simply attaching the target ( to a word or phrase which can easily be spoken and remembered by someone else.  Whether you are trying to share your new address with a long lost friend you met at the market, or a funny YouTube video with an audience of thousands, you can do so simply and verbally by telling them the Yumber. So what is a Yumber? A Yumber is a word or phrase that redirects the user to a specific target. A target can be a URL, phone number, physical address, email address, file, collection of files, photos, etc. virtually anything you want to share can be tied to a Yumber and then shared verbally face to face, over the radio, on the tv, or from a stage to thousands of people.  Try it yourself, goto Yumber.com and enter the Yumber:  One man band  You will find yourself watching a YouTube video located at a complicated YouTube URL without requiring you to speak the computer language necessary to read that lengthy YouTube address:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXMuWi0dUBc  So what is a Yumber? It is natural, it is the marriage of word of mouth and technology, it is the way you learned to speak from birth, which technology, until now, has attempted to train out of you. With Yumber.com you can share anything with anyone anywhere using a simple word or phrase that you created for that purpose.  Why tell someone I will email you the link later, Or I will email you the file later, when you can simply tell them the associated Yumber to the target now and allow them to look it up at their convenience? The Internet was created by techies for techies. However, even these techies realized the need to evolve the Internet when the number of sites grew to the point at which it become difficult to remember all of the IP addresses of the new sites.  In its infancy the Internet was navigates by using IP addresses such as 192.168.0.1. To simplify navigation the a second layer was created, which is the domain name based system we still use today. This domain name system, complete with https, .coms, and /'s alike, is still on the level with the old and unintuitive MS DOS command prompt.  Just as Apple evolved the computer with its intuitive and human friendly operating system, Yumber is seeking to evolve the sharing of technology by adding another layer of simplicity that is more intuitive than the last. Instead of humans having to conform with the confines of computer language as defined by technology, Yumber adds a layer of humanity to technology allowing people to share themselves and their interests verbally in face to face settings.  Whether one on one, or while presenting to large audiences, Yumber helps you to put the power back in word of mouth communication."
