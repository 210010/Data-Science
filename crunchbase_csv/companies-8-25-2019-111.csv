The Omni evolves virtual reality one step further, allowing anyone to stand up and traverse virtual worlds with the natural use of their own feet. Moving naturally in virtual reality creates an unprecedented sense of immersion. True virtual reality cannot be experienced sitting down. The panoramic visuals offered by head mounted displays need corresponding natural movement to maintain our sense of orientation and feeling of immersion. The Omni will free gamers from passive, seated gameplay, unleashing the full potential of virtual reality gaming with the Oculus Rift and future head mounted displays. Gaming on a keyboard, mouse or gamepad while seated pales in comparison to the intense experience and fun that comes from actually walking, running, and jumping in games. The Omni is the result of two years of design and testing. The base of the Omni is a grooved, low-friction surface. Special shoes keep the foot stabilized and prevent lateral sliding. Users walk naturally—and the result is a natural interface that works with any game or application that uses keyboard input. Walk, run, jump, or strafe—movements mapped to the keyboard can be mapped to natural motion with the Omni. Applications of natural movement in virtual reality stretch far beyond gaming: training and simulation, fitness, virtual tourism, virtual tradeshows and events, meet-ups and multi-person adventures, virtual workplaces, museums, VR architecture, VR concerts… The possibilities are limitless. The Virtuix Omni is now available for pre-order online. Visit our online store here."

Colorectal cancer is the second-deadliest form of the disease, and along with conditions like Diverticulitis and Crohn’s, treatment often requires a colectomy, almost 400,000 of which are performed each year in the U.S. alone. Two-thirds of these procedures are still performed open, requiring a long, gruesome incision. VIC’s simpler/easier/cheaper approach is to insert a mini-robot into the insufflated abdomen via a small umbilical incision, after which the highly-dextrous robot arms are freely manipulated at the nearby surgeon console. VIC enables MIS colectomy using well-known laparoscopic tools, onboard vision, and leading multi-quadrant capabilities.

VideoKen,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/videoken,"Education, Internet, Social",VideoKen is an AI-based platform that makes informational videos rich and consumable.,"About us: Millions of informational videos are available on internet, but are highly underutilized due to the short attention span of people. VideoKen is an AI-based platform that makes informational videos rich and consumable. It uses AI techniques to automatically index videos, creating table-of-contents and phrase cloud, which nicely summarize key topics in a video, and lets viewers jump directly to the topics of interest within a video. It also supports more effective video search (without a reliance on manual tags), lead generation for businesses, and rich insights into video viewing behavior of the target audience. Problem Statement: Videos account for roughly 75% of the internet traffic. Enterprises are using informational videos for employee learning, sales enablement, marketing and internal communication. However, the intended viewers rarely have the time and patience to watch more than a few minutes of these videos. On a related note, although millions of learning videos are freely available, covering practically any topic, it is well known that learners get disengaged very quickly. VideoKen is transforming the way people consume and utilize informational videos, and in the process, also creating value for the organizations creating the video content. Example: Here are some of the sample links that illustrate how hard it is to peer inside and navigate long videos on the popular (and powerful) YouTube platform, and the difference made by AI-based techniques (explained below) in VideoKen. 1.

The first trend was the rise in availability of WiFi across higher education campuses; the second was the rapid adoption of smart phone and tablet devices by students and adult learners; and the third was the increase in large, hybrid and distance learning classroom configurations at most higher educational institutions. Today this foresight has become reality, as WiFi is available in virtually every classroom, over 50% of course material today is delivered outside the physical classroom for classes of all sizes and configurations, and there is near ubiquity for student ownership of at least one smart device. In addition to rapid technology transitions in the classroom, there is competitive pressure to implement state-of-the-art instructional technology at every university to address the demands of today’s digitally savvy students. Students do not want to sit quietly in lectures in any sized classroom. Instead they want to learn by exploring and actively engaging with instructors and peer students. Via Response was launched specifically to enable instructors to engage today’s tech savvy, interactive students with a state-of-the-art student engagement platform that leverages technologies that are the norm in today’s digital classrooms. We hope you will take the time to test drive Via in your classroom today!"

The IT administrator applies patches once to a master virtual machine. Upon republishing, the changed data is streamed to NxTop PCs running the virtual machine. A patched image is assembled in  the background and  transparently loaded on the next reboot.  IT can also easily rollback a patch. Integrated Security AES-256 Disk Encryption. All virtual machine and system data on NxTop- enabled PCs can be encrypted, providing peace of a mind in the event that a PC containing sensitive data is lost or stolen. Policy Controls. IT administrators can protect against data leakage and  unauthorized  use through a  robust set of policy controls.  Access to hardware such as  USB ports and network interfaces can be restricted  or filtered  based on centrally  defined policies at global, group, and individual-user  levels. Virtual machines can be  governed by time-based  expiration  policies and  on-demand remote disablement. Remote Termination  with  Data Destruction. As an added layer of security, IT administrators can flag lost PCs for remote termination. If  a  lost  or  stolen  PC  connects  to  a  network, it  is directed  to digitally  shred all data and  encryption keys, then self- destruct. Hassle-Free Data Backup and Restore Transparent Data Protection. Based on   centrally  defined policies, NxTop periodically initiates  data backup with no  end-user interaction required. Efficient Data Transmission. NxTop   backup  technology captures changes at the block level, transmitting only the blocks that have changed to NxTop Center. Advanced  Management for Distributed Organizations Intelligent Remote Office Caching. Downstream management servers may be deployed at remote offices to intelligently cache and distribute updates for more efficient bandwidth utilization. Local Backup Storage.  User data backups may be  localized at remote offices, speeding system recovery and  avoiding unnecessary strain on wide area network links. Remote Helpdesk. Simply  enable remote  support  from  the  NxTop  Center  console  for  immediate remote PC control even in the event of a catastrophic operating system failure such as a Windows blue screen of death."
