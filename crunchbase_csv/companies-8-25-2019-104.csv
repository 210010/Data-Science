Ukkobox,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ukkobox,"Cloud Data Services, Cyber Security, Information Technology, Internet, Security",Multi cloud protected storage layer service for high sensitive data.,"Ukkobox helps SMEs deal with personal data in a secure and compliant manner.  Sensitive data loss and leaks are problems faced by more than 78% of SMBs according to a 2014 survey. Among them, 72% shut down less than 1 year after the incident. Just one of these incidents led to $6.2M losses. The solutions currently are either insufficient of too expensive for these companies. Ukkobox (Company no. 09527513 - UK). has an easy tool that safely encrypts and spreads user files to existing cloud providers worldwide. Because they store only parts of the files on each provider with redundancy, they are secured and accessible even if some of these providers suffer an outage or are hacked.  Their unique dispersal process developed by Univ. of São Paulo (Brazil) and Univ. of Leicester (UK) represents an entry technological barrier that can be patented. If the user requires additional privacy levels, they can choose providers from states with weak international relations among themselves and distinct data privacy laws/regulations. This provides an additional geopolitical security mechanism resilient to encryption vulnerabilities, which makes unauthorized access even from governments almost impossible. They will have to cooperate with ""enemies"" countries to retrieve all data slices and also break data encryption to access user files.This technology able to scale globally along with a multi-skilled team, composed with founders with high technical security and cloud background, business knowledge, international law and creative marketing and design are the most interesting Ukkobox assets.  For the user it is straightforward. He just download and install their  app, choose the providers and countries he wishes to use for his spreading storage box, receives a temporary authentication token in his mobile and put the files inside Ukkobox folder. Their app will then encrypt, split and spread the files from the user device to storage providers directly. This ensures that they will have zero knowledge of the user stored data and access patterns. Thus ensuring full privacy for their customer's stored data. They will monetize their  solution using a SaaS model. The consumer chooses the providers (and countries) used to create his private data storage network, the storage size he need and the amount of users. From these informations, the monthly/yearly price is calculated. This model offers the reliability to use several storage providers at the same time avoiding vendor lock-in, increasing availability, privacy and security but with the convenience to manage only one account."
