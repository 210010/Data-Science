Getting-in,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/getting-in,"Advice, Education, Online Portals",The UK's leading educational website,"Getting-in reinvents online educational advice and proves a hit with students The world of education is moving increasingly online, with students, teachers and parents alike now making heavy use of educational resources on the web to study and plan their next career, training or educational steps. Nowhere can this trend be seen more clearly than through the example of Getting-in, an educational portal that caters for every conceivable area of life that secondary-level children, students and career-minded young people could need as they prepare themselves for their futures.  It has already enjoyed phenomenal success, building up a dedicated online following and experiencing an explosion in its readership base. This hasn’t just taken the form of visitors to the site, but also students getting involved through its social media presence, such as its Twitter feed, which keeps students updated with crucial information about areas such as open-day dates and other developments in the world of careers and education. In part the popularity of the site is down to the quality of the resources that it offers. Created by professional writers and careers and education experts, the quality of its advice articles and study resources is unparalleled. Students looking for advice on where to apply to university get insightful and practical advice from is Applying section, while GCSE and A-Level students have access to revision guides for all of the most popular secondary-level subjects that bring the curricula to life. Students can book on to open days all over the UK and courses. However, what has really set Getting-in apart from other educational sites and made it such a hit with young people is that it pays every bit as much attention to the needs of young people who want to head into the world of work or training rather than continue with their studies, or people who have not yet made up their minds about such dilemmas. It offers a huge range of articles and guides on finding job opportunities, taking a gap year, exploring training options and even setting up a business. In an age where higher education carries a considerable financial burden, young people are looking more than they have done for several generations for equally rewarding opportunities, something that Getting-in seems to be one of the very first sites to recognize. Getting-in has also made itself popular through some highly innovative extra features, such as an extensive database of university and college profiles profiles. Also a calendar of open days with a booking system, and a wide selection of special offers for students at the UK’s most popular high-street stores and restaurants. With the momentum behind Getting-in looking to be unstoppable—the site has been receiving more and more visitors every single month since it was launched—not only is it proving that the future of education advice and resources lies online, but it is also leading the way in defining the possibilities of how the Internet can help young people best prepare for their futures in an ever-more competitive job market and an increasingly expensive educational world."

Got a long day ahead and want to make things happen? It's time to get BIzzy Coffee.,"Alex and Andrew started Bizzy with one goal in mind, to create the highest quality and most convenient products on the market. Their passion for cold brew coffee started years ago after graduating from college. At the time, both had corporate jobs, were training for a 24-hour obstacle race, and were running a group fitness company. Because of their busy schedules and drive to succeed, sleep became less important to them. In order to be their best, they needed something that could give them a quick jolt of energy. At first, they would drink anything that would keep them awake. As former college students, they started with what they knew - energy drinks. They quickly found that this was an extremely unhealthy option and one that would leave them with a hard crash once the sugar wore off. As they looked further into what was actually in these products they were disgusted at the amount of sugar and synthetic ingredients they were consuming. So, like any corporate employee would do, they turned to their trusty friend, coffee.  Every morning they would wake up 15 minutes early just to brew a pot of drip coffee, but just like everything else they tried, it had several drawbacks. The coffee took way too long to brew, produced a terrible tasting product, and wasn't convenient to take with them. Three things that in their mind were unacceptable. In the summer of 2012  they stumbled upon cold brew coffee. It fulfilled all of their requirements for the perfect source of energy, it was natural, sugar-free, and simple, but there was one very significant drawback, it wasn't at all convenient. To make it on their own took them 24 hours and if they wanted to buy it they had to wait in-line at a coffee shop. Over the next several years their love for cold brew grew, and so did their frustration with its lack of convenience and availability. They spent the next 2-years researching a way to create the highest quality product, in the most convenient way, and in 2015 they launched Bizzy - the healthiest and most convenient coffee on the market."

General Tools & Instruments,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/general-tools-instruments,"Consumer Electronics, Electronics, Hardware, Manufacturing, Retail, Virtual Reality","General Tools & Instruments, began as the brainchild of Abe and Lillian Rosenberg in New York City, 1922.","General Tools & Instruments, began as the brainchild of Abe and Lillian Rosenberg in New York City, 1922.  Originally dubbed General Hardware Manufacturing Co., the company specialized in the wholesale of ""hard goods,"" offering a full-range of domestic and professional items from clothesline pulleys and screen-door hardware, to specialty hand tools. However it wasn't long before Abe, a former WWI soldier and a vibrant, creative thinker, began to conceptualize his own product ideas.  With Lillian running the store, Abe would take the Fall River Line from Greenwich Village to New England in search of machine shops to manufacture his tools.  By 1930 he had outsourced a small line of specialty items, including circle cutters, metal punches and pocket screwdrivers.  By 1937, Abe and Lillian were selling their own products exclusively at General Hardware. Abe continued to develop a line of useful products for both consumer and commercial purposes.  His thirst for new ideas kept General at the forefront of the industry and, accordingly, the company became one of the first to build die-cast tools.  Through Lillian's keen business management, the company was awarded contracts supplying machinist tools to the United States Military and the British Purchasing Commission during WWII.  In 1946, General became a charter member of the Sears 100 Club of Craftsman tool suppliers. Upon Abe's death in 1977, his daughter Dorothy became Chairman of the Board.  Along with her husband, Seymour Weinstein, Dorothy expanded General's product line to include precision measuring tools and other specialty hand tools.  In 1990, the company's name was officially changed to General Tools to better reflect its product line.  Today, General Tools is run by Dorothy's son Gerald Weinstein.  Under Gerry's leadership, General has expanded its product line to include electronic testing and measurement equipment, fueled by the much-heralded acquisition of Mannix Instruments in November of 2006.   The company, now General Tools and Instruments, continues to forge a path into the digital marketplace all the while holding true to the entrepreneurial spirit upon which it began."

Geely Auto Group,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/geely,Automotive,"automobile manufacturer based in Hangzhou, China","Geely Auto Group is a leading automobile manufacturer based in Hangzhou, China and was founded in 1997 as a subsidiary of Zhejiang Geely Holding Group. Geely Auto Group sells vehicles under the Geely Auto brand and holds a 50% stake in the LYNK & CO brand. The company employs more than 50,000 people and operates 12 plants. Geely vehicles are sold through a network of over 1000 dealerships in China and some 350 sales and service outlets in overseas markets. The company has been listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange since 2005. In 2018, Geely Auto Group sold a record high 1,500,838 units, an increase of 20.3% from previous year.  Founding Geely in 1986 as a refrigerator maker with money borrowed from family, Li Shufu transformed the company into a success selling inexpensive products to Chinese consumers. After the purchase of a failing, state-run firm, Geely manufactured motorcycles in the mid-1990s. Small van production began in 1998, and a year later, it received state approval to manufacture automobiles. Car production began in 2002. A subsidiary of the group, Geely Auto, had its IPO on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong in 2004. The company had a booth at the 2005 Frankfurt Motor Show, and a 2006 showing at the Detroit auto show. Geely approached Ford in mid-2008 about a possible takeover of Volvo Cars. On October 28, 2009, it was named as the preferred buyer of Volvo by the American automaker. A deal was reached in late March and completed in early August, 2010. In 2010, total sales of over 415,000 units gave the company a near 2% market share. Sales were lower than a reported 680,000 units per year production capacity. In December 2011, it was announced that Geely would begin selling Chinese-designed and -manufactured cars in the United Kingdom at the end of 2012, with the first model to go on sale being the Emgrand EC7. The company has also stated its intention to begin sales in Italy. In May 2017, Geely confirmed plans to purchase a 51% controlling-stake in Lotus Cars from its owner, DRB-HICOM. Additionally, Geely plans to purchase a 49.9% stake in PROTON Holdings, to facilitate future export growth in right-hand drive markets. The deals were seen as an important step for the Chinese carmaker in their quest to make inroads into the lucrative ASEAN region. In July 2017 the company purchased Terrafugia, an American maker of flying cars. In November 2017, Geely announced completion of the Terrafugia acquisition, including approval from all relevant regulators.

The Company believes these deposits represent the largest primary cobalt resource in the world. In the early 1990s, Geovic's founder and current Executive Vice President of Exploration, William (Bill) Buckovic, in partnership with the Government of Cameroon via its State Investment Corporation, recognized the economic potential of the uniquely high cobalt grades in these nickel laterite desposits.  Subsequently, he spent a decade raising capital to explore them further, ultimately leading to the creation of both Geovic Mining and Geovic Cameroon PLC.  Geovic Mining went public on the Vancouver Stock Exchange in December 2006, and currently trades on both the NEX Stock Exchange (GMC.TO) and U.S. Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board (GVCM.OB) markets. GMC's unique mineral deposits facilitate the use of inexpensive, yet highly efficient concentration and hydrometallugical processing methods, unlike those of any other cobalt-nickel project in the world. As a result, projected capital costs will be low, operating costs globally competitive, and financial metrics likely very strong.  Moreover, Geovic Cameroon's extensive resources on the mine permit (seven catalogued deposites) should enable substantially expanded production rates for numerous decades."
