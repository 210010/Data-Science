These recent Malta and Gibraltar-based acquisitions have led them to become a key player in the UK Motor insurance market and provide greater access to direct business that has historically not found its way to reinsurers.  Their strength in account management underpins what they do and they pride theirselves on the quality of their relationships. By connecting deep sector experience to technical underwriting expertise, they are able to tackle the most exacting of re-insurance challenges around  the world."
