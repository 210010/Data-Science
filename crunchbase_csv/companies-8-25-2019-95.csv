They kick-started their operations in Bangalore with a simple yet effective solution – Internet Protocol (IP) cameras with built-in intelligence to detect events automatically.

The focus was also on being a ‘complete solutions company’ rather than being just a ‘product company’. Silvan’s objective is simple – to cater to an evolving Indian lifestyle, which demands a fresh approach, wherein a modern and traditional way of life can co-exist. Silvan’s solutions for home automation has been welcomed by several big players in the field of housing – Sobha, Brigade, Nambiar Builders, Total Environment, Tata Housing, and Lodha to name a few.

Our cloud communications platform reaches every mobile phone on the planet, in seconds or less, through mobile messaging or voice & video calling.Back in 2008, our six founders set out to reinvent mobile messaging. They rented the shop window of a boutique travel agency in Stockholm and quickly set about launching the very first version of our messaging platform. The team recognized that businesses loved text messaging for its immediate reach and its ubiquity as a communications channel. Well, do you know anyone without a mobile phone? But making mobile messaging simple would be key to the success of their new business. With this simplicity in mind, they also recognized that the market was moving towards using cloud-based platforms, rather than building bespoke in-house tools and hiring expensive on-site development experts. And so their vision of mobile messaging was born! Today we are 500 people strong, with a local presence in over 40 locations. Our cloud platform now supports messaging, voice and video, and handles 25 billion API transactions per year. We’re proud to work with some of the world’s largest and most demanding customers, including 8 out of the 10 largest U.S. tech enterprises, as well as mobile operators all around the world. Though we’re growing quickly, we maintain the ethos of our humble beginnings.

We have hundreds of direct connections to mobile operators, ensuring leading quality without middlemen. We’re a leader in our field, stock-listed at Nasdaq Stockholm, and a trusted software vendor to many mobile operators around the world. Technology is redrawing the boundaries for what’s possible.

With a growing number of ways to communicate, businesses risk a fragmented customer journey unless they master and leverage the most relevant and engaging channels. That’s why our customers appreciate the tools and technology we provide for creating richer messages, with imagery and video, to turn notifications into conversations. We’ve come a long way, and we’re just scratching the surface of what’s possible, for us and for our clients. In 2019 we decided to unify our business under the Sinch brand – we’re excited about this next step in our journey.

Sierra Oncology,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pronai-therapeutics,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Life Science, Therapeutics",Sierra Oncology is a clinical stage drug development company advancing targeted therapeutics for the treatment of patients with cancer. ,"Sierra Oncology is a clinical stage drug development company advancing targeted therapeutics for the treatment of patients with cancer. We are an ambitious oncology-focused company, oriented towards achieving the successful registration and commercialization of our product candidates. We have a highly experienced management team with a proven track record of success in oncology drug development and we are advancing an emerging pipeline of next generation therapies that target the DNA Damage Response (DDR) network. Our lead product candidate, SRA737, is a potent, highly selective, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1). Chk1 is a key regulator of cell cycle progression and the DDR replication response. In cancer cells, intrinsic replication stress is induced by factors such as oncogenes (e.g., MYC or CCNE1), genetic mutations in DNA repair machinery (e.g., BRCA1 or FA), genetic mutations leading to a dysregulated cell cycle (e.g., TP53 or RAD50) or other genomic alterations. This replication stress results in persistent DNA damage and genomic instability leading to an increased dependency on Chk1 for survival. Targeted inhibition of Chk1 by SRA737 may therefore be synthetically lethal to cancer cells with elevated intrinsic replication stress and have utility as a monotherapy in a range of tumor indications. The combination of SRA737 with other modalities, such as other agents that target the DDR network and certain chemotherapeutics, may also provide synergistic anti-tumor activity via a variety of potential biological mechanisms. Importantly, the oral bioavailability of SRA737 may afford greater dosing flexibility for both monotherapy and combination therapy settings than is possible with intravenously administered agents. We are pursuing an innovative development plan for SRA737, which is currently being evaluated in two Phase 1/2 clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer. SRA737-01 is intended to evaluate SRA737’s potential to induce synthetic lethality as monotherapy, while the SRA737-02 is intended to evaluate the combination of SRA737 potentiated by subtherapeutic, low dose gemcitabine. Concurrently, we are conducting preclinical research evaluating SRA737 in combination with other DDR-targeted agents, including poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, as well as with immuno-oncology therapeutics, that may guide a potential next wave of clinical development for our asset, possibly further broadening its therapeutic utility. We are also advancing SRA141, a potent, selective, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of cell division cycle 7 kinase (Cdc7). Cdc7 is a key regulator of DNA replication and is involved in the DDR network, making it a compelling emerging target for potential treatment across a broad range of tumor types. SRA141 is currently undergoing preclinical research in preparation for an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expected in late 2018. Sierra Oncology retains the global commercialization rights to both SRA737 and SRA141."

The tourism sector currently contributes 4 per cent to Singapore’s gross domestic product and supports some 160,000 jobs. Tourism plays an essential role in reinforcing Singapore’s status as a vibrant global city that is a magnet for capital, businesses and talent. It also enhances the quality and diversity of leisure options for local residents and helps to create a living environment that Singaporeans can be proud to call home. STB strives to ensure that tourism remains an important economic pillar through long-term strategic planning, and by forging partnerships, driving innovation and ensuring excellence in the tourism sector. It continues to market Singapore’s mult​i-faceted appeal as a premier business, leisure, healthcare and education destination, and offer empowering and customised experiences through the ""YourSingapore"" destination brand. These initiatives are reinforced by its international operations, which build affinity for Singapore through customised and differentiated marketing campaigns. The Board also regularly reviews and updates the tourism regulatory framework to ensure its relevance in the current business environment, while providing support and incentives to catalyse the private sector to take the lead in investing for growth. While STB leads in driving tourism development, it cannot do it alone; continued support from industry players is crucial in ensuring the success and sustainable growth of the sector. In the face of growing challenges such as resource scarcity and increasingly discerning travellers, there is a need to focus on yield-driven quality growth. As such, STB and tourism industry players have to work collaboratively to continue to innovate and create value for visitors. STB also aims to facilitate the sharing of experiences, expertise and resources among industry players to raise industry capability and competitiveness, maximise business opportunities and forge long-term win-win partnerships. Strong support and active participation from Singapore residents are also imperative to the tourism sector as they are an integral part of Singapore’s identity and appeal. STB will continue to work with tourism industry partners to nurture public engagement as part of its tourism development efforts; every local resident is a potential advocate for tourism and together, their collective ideas and energies can contribute to the sustainable development of the tourism sector. To navigate the tourism sector through the next phase of growth, STB will be pursuing Quality Tourism - a model of tourism development that emphasises innovative enterprise, local engagement and strong economic contribution."

With licensed agents serving consumers in all 50 states and a technology-driven portfolio of value-added services for clients of all stripes, Simple Health is committed to cutting through the complex and often contradictory indicators that impede rational health insurance decisions and connecting underserved clients with plans that fit their needs and budgets. Launched in the early 2010s by Steve Dorfman in the wake of the Affordable Care Act rollout, Simple Health is built on a customer-first foundation. Simple Health’s intuitive plan search tools allow consumers to rapidly seek and find appropriate health plans. Plain-English descriptions coupled with user-friendly features make the notoriously confusing process manageable for everyday consumers. Simple Health’s health plan options include individual and family health insurance plans; group health insurance plans; short-term health insurance plans; and accidental, critical illness, and supplemental insurance plans. Individual and family health insurance plans are appropriate for single individuals who need to insure only themselves, as well as heads of household who wish to provide insurance for spouses and dependents outside the confines of an employer-based plan. Simple Health offers access to plans at a range of costs and coverage levels, from essentials-only options to gold-plated plans with low deductibles and generous coverage. Group health insurance plans offer the best of both worlds: a degree of flexibility and choice normally associated with individual plans combined with economies of scale normally associated with employer-based plans.  Short-term health insurance plans are essential for consumers who need to bridge gaps between jobs, prior to Medicare eligibility, or after aging off a parent’s insurance plan, among other situations. Simple Health helps customers make sense of the options available in their states and the specific use cases for which short-term health insurance may or may not be appropriate.  Accidental, critical illness, and supplemental health insurance plans are also known as high-deductible health plans (HDHPs). They’re appropriate for cost-conscious consumers willing to pay “first dollar” costs out of pocket until their deductibles are met. Since even healthy individuals can face unexpected, potentially catastrophic healthcare costs, these plans provide crucial peace of mind during the most productive years of life. Simple Health offers all these plan types through a network of expert agents licensed to provide insurance in all 50 states. Every Simple Health agent undergoes a rigorous training process that equips them to handle a vast array of situations. Unlike most health insurance marketplaces, Simple Health offers a people-driven experience designed to put healthcare consumers at ease during what’s often a confusing, chaotic time in their lives. Simple Health practices what it preaches. Founder Steve Dorfman is a vocal champion of gender equality in the workplace, a generous donor to causes close to his heart, and an ally to women and minority STEM professionals in Florida and beyond. In 2015, Dorfman was named a 40 Under 40: Top Young Entrepreneur by the South Florida Business Journal and selected as a finalist for its Insurance Industry Up and Comers list. "
