Lotz and Bradford at, and exclusively licensed from, UC San Francisco.

This same consortium provides the foundation for Nocimed's on-going direction and execution, which has already successfully achieved many significant milestones.  The company has conducted its operations since early 2008 on over $3.5 million dollars of Series A Preferred financing.  This was raised via private placement “Angel” investments via accredited investors, including from each of the company’s founders and a long list of world renowned thought leaders in spine surgery, pain management, and imaging/radiology.

The company already achieved many significant development milestones for its primary first investigational product, NociscanTM, involving multiple inventions captured in intellectual property owned by the Company. The company initially sponsored a $1MM/2 year co-development program at UCSF from early 2008 to early 2010.  This principally featured feasibility clinical studies to initially develop the technology for use with one initial commercially available high field MR system for robustly acquired and post-processed in vivo MRS data, and to train a diagnostic algorithm based on that MRS data which correlates highly to pain and degeneration per other standard diagnostic controls (e.g. including invasive discogram for pain).  The data from this initial investigational clinical development study demonstrated high procedural success for the Nociscan MRS diagnostic platform, with extremely high diagnostic accuracy against standard controls for diagnosing discs as painful vs. non-painful, and was the subject of multiple podium presentations in various medical and scientific society venues.  Nocimed's more recent activities and objectives have been to advance Nociscan in next investigational development steps from the successful initial development and feasibility experience enjoyed at UC San Francisco.  This has principally involved development for cross-platform use via multiple different MR system platforms from different manufacturers, and while gathering more clinical data for assessing correlations and algorithm training.  The company plans to complete this development under an on-going multi-platform, multi-center study that was IRB approved in October 2011 and launched on a first platform (Siemens 3T Verio) in November 2011.  While Nociscan is being developed and evaluated for compatible use with various MR systems from multiple manufacturers, the company is using the current study and conducting concurrent negotiations to evaluate which MR system(s) will be chosen for advancement for future trials, regulatory pathways, and ultimate planned commercialization in the future.  Upon successful completion of this study, the company plans to freeze the platform design for a first generation planned product offering, and conduct a prospective, multi-center trial to further confirm the robustness of the uses intended for regulatory clearance of the platform.  These latter activities are likely to be conducted via a multi-$ million dollar Series B Preferred financing that the company plans to conduct by mid-2011."

Novicap,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/novicap,"Finance, Financial Services, FinTech",NoviCap allows businesses to receive early payments for their outstanding invoices within 48 hours.,"NoviCap was started in 2014 with a mission to make invoice finance universal and effortless. The invoice finance industry has been around for a long time and has rightly gained a reputation for predatory legal and commercial practices. Since they started NoviCap, it has become clear to us that traditional invoice finance firms make their product sound needlessly complex in order to charge higher rates and confusing fees. The root cause for this widespread industry behaviour is systemic as factoring firms have a lot of overhead costs. They do not leverage technology to offer online services and rely on expensive field sales to gain clients. Many are so low-tech that they run their business entirely on excel spreadsheets. The few firms that use software are using expensive legacy systems. This inefficient cost structure causes traditional firms to overcharge their customers and to save money in customer service. This is why in 2014 they started NoviCap and have built their technology from the ground up with the customer in mind. The end result is an invoice finance facility where every step is easy, fast and transparent. You can experience this difference with their instant pricing, fast onboarding, rapid turnaround, simple fee structure and ultimately much lower rates. Since their technology eliminated so much inefficiencies it has become truly easy to use. They are able to give customers a simple 'push for cash' button in their existing invoicing software."

Net Reviews,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/net-reviews,"Information Technology, Internet, Professional Services",Net Reviews SAS created an international solution specialised in the collection and publication of customer’s reviews.,"Founded in April 2012 by Olivier Mouillet, Laurent Abisset and Tom Brami, Verified Reviews is the solution developed by Net Reviews to guarantee that customer reviews are genuine. Fake reviews published on websites are now a thing of the past. Avis Vérifiés guarantees trustworthiness. How? By collecting feedback from customers who have actually had an experience with a particular store, by enabling a dialog between company and customer during the moderation phase, and by displaying genuine customer reviews as a result of this process. In a few short years, Avis Vérifiés has established itself as the leader in customer reviews in France. With an international team of 60, Avis Vérifiés boasts a 5,000-strong client base including many major French players such as oui.sncf, SFR, Bricorama, and But. Between 2014 and 2017, the company’s revenue increased fivefold.  **Avis Vérifiés: from Marseille-based startup to French leader of customer-review gathering** Who has never looked up reviews by other web users before buying a product online? 85% of web users read customer reviews before making a purchase online and 91% of those who read reviews consider them to be the number 1 factor influencing their decision to buy. Customer testimonials play a key role in the act of purchasing and have a big impact on the e-reputation of brands. And yet, according to an investigation conducted by France’s General Directorate for Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) in 2016, 35% of reviews published online are fake. To put it plainly, one out of three times someone will have left a comment about a restaurant they have never been to or rated a product they have never bought. That’s where Avis Vérifiés steps in. Avis Vérifiés is certified as compliant with the French national standard for service (NF Service). It offers a solution to gather website reviews (online shopping experience), product reviews, but also store reviews (experience in brick-and-mortar stores). The solution centers on 3 complementary services: *   Review gathering:  Avis Vérifiés sends a personalized email to all customers – with no pre-selection – to request a review submission. The reviews are gathered from customers who have been  authenticated via a proof of purchase. *   Moderation: It offers web merchants the possibility of responding to and dealing with a customer’s issue before their review is published.  *   Review display: All reviews are published, whether they are positive or negative. Web merchants cannot modify or delete comments. By default, reviews are displayed from most recent to oldest. **A solution that is spreading across Europe and the American markets** 6 years after its creation in 2012, Avis Vérifiés now boasts a team of 60 employees. In Europe, the Marseille-based head office is backed up by the Madrid and Berlin offices. In the United States, the development of the North and South American markets is managed from a subsidiary opened in Miami, an office in Boston. This development will now gather speed with the acquisition of Trusted Company in Brazil which positions Avis Vérifiés as the market leader in South America.  The solution is also deployed in Italy, Portugal, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. In each country its name is translated into the local language (Avis Vérifiés, Opiniones Verificadas…).   **Exceptional growth recognized by different awards and rankings ** Net Reviews, which publishes the Avis Vérifiés solution, is ranked 38th by Deloitte in its national Technology Fast 50 ranking (France) and is in the 170th place in the FAST 500 EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa), which recognizes the top 500 companies with the highest growth rate in this region.  Net Reviews also came 40th out of 500 in the Les Champions de la Croissance 2018 ranking organized by French daily newspaper Les Echos. Since 2016, Avis Vérifiés is also an award-winner in Pass French Tech, a national program to support the nuggets of the French Tech industry, i.e. companies achieving hypergrowth.  "

Nymbl Science,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nymbl-science,"Fitness, Health Care, Software","Nymbl training helps maintain & improve your balance for a better quality of life, at every age. ","About Nymbl Science: Nymbl Science is a Colorado based company with the mission of using medical science and mobile technology to improve balance and prevent 1 million falls.  The Nymbl System leverages validated studies, plus our Chief Scientist Dr. JP Farcy’s 35 years of clinical experience to provide a mobile-based balance improvement solution.  Nymbl consists of (1) a comprehensive balance evaluation and (2) a balance improvement program designed to be delivered on the smartphone or in a class.  The Balance Evaluation is a 3-part test administered on a smartphone or tablet that guides the user through the required exercises in approximately 5 minutes.  These tests measure stability, strength, and movement, and conform to the CDC STEADI protocol for balance measurement.  The user is provided with a numerical balance score (1-100), an age group percentile, and the score is divided into its component parts. If a user is at risk for falls in any of the three categories, this is displayed.  The Balance Training app is a self-guided or coach-led intervention that prescribes appropriate exercises based on the balance score and provides simultaneous cognitive challenges. This “dual tasking” approach stimulates brain plasticity and mimics real world settings where a user may fall because they become distracted. The exercises parallel the Otago recommendation, which demonstrated a 35% reduction in falls, plus exercises recommended by the Harvard Medical School.   The app animates and times the exercises for the user either in home or in a class setting. The cognitive challenges, which are made up of trivia, math, pattern matching, memory problems etc. engage the user, and the participants are often seen laughing while they perform their tandem stands, lunges and wall sits.  While the primary purpose of the cognitive challenges is to improve brain plasticity, they also make the training fun and increase user engagement. We have implemented our program in senior living communities with compelling results – community members who have gone through the program have increased their balance scores over 30% on average in 30 days, and  in one community 50% of the residents who were at fall risk (based on the CDC measure) were no longer at risk! Nymbl won the 2017 Prime Health Competition, as the most promising health tech startup in Colorado.  We received offers from Kaiser Permanente, University of Colorado Health, Centura and SCL Health for pilot programs, all of which are proceeding.  We have signed an Innovation Partnership with UCHealth.  These key healthcare organizations  are looking to reduce falls both in-patient and out-patient, and also use our measure of balance as a ""vital sign"" to improve population outcomes."

Known for its passionate fan base, one-of-a-kind playoff format (Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup), development of the modern sports sponsorship and commitment to enhancing auto racing through technology, NASCAR produces many of the most highly attended sporting events in the world. NASCAR did not gain the success or popularity it has today overnight. The sport has evolved to entertain its fans and continuously prosper. In 2003, NASCAR made two major announcements to help the dawn of the new era become even clearer. NASCAR announced in June that Nextel would become the new series sponsor in 2004, replacing R.J. Reynolds' Winston brand after 33 years. Three months later in September, Brian Z. France was named as NASCAR's CEO and Chairman of the Board replacing his father, Bill France. A steady parade of changes has followed. The Chase for the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup was announced at the start of 2004, ushering in a new format to determine the champion of NASCAR's premier series. In 2006, Toyota announced a move into all three of NASCAR's national series. In 2007 it was announced that the premier series' name would be changed to the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series beginning in 2008. In addition, Nationwide Insurance was announced as the replacement for Anheuser-Busch as main sponsor of NASCAR's series born from Late Models in 1982. The 2007 season also marked the beginning of NASCAR's new car in premier series competition, a car designed to be safer than ever while also reducing costs to compete -- all the while enhancing the racing itself. The new car could not slow down Jimmie Johnson who captured a record five consecutive championships from 2006-2010, becoming only the second driver to win three consecutive titles (Cale Yarborough 1976-1978). During the late 2000s, NASCAR began further expanding by creating series internationally. The NASCAR Canadian Tire Series and the NASCAR Toyota Series (Mexico) launched their inaugural seasons in 2007. The sanctioning body extended its reach across the Atlantic when it founded the NASCAR Whelen Euro Series in 2012. Today, NASCAR runs three national series, four regional series, one local grassroots series and three international series. In 2013, NASCAR continued enhance its racing, debuting its Gen-6 car that enhanced body designs to better resemble the cars found in showrooms across the United States and improve on-track performance. NASCAR also secured its television rights through 2024 by agreeing to a 10-year rights deal with NBC Universal and an eight-year rights extension with FOX. To emphasize winning races, NASCAR created a new Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup playoff format for 2014 and unveiled its new grid format for advancing drivers."
