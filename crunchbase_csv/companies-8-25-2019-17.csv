To achieve that goal, DataNovo has created the first AI- and machine learning-based system that offers three core features: (1) licensing; (2) AI-driven prior art searches; and (3) patent analytics.  For licensing, with a single key stroke, DataNovo's Software-as-a-Service platform allows any individual or corporate entity to identify potential infringers and associated infringing products to every U.S. patent, and helps patent owners advance monetization efforts and secure licensing opportunities.  For AI-driven prior art searches, with a single patent number (instead of keywords), DataNovo offers users the best prior art against that patent instantaneously. Using artificial intelligence and machine learning, DataNovo aims to reduce search speed, improve result accuracy, and minimize cost. Companies interested in patent landscape can also use DataNovo's patented platform to check if their new product may infringe on any existing patent.   For patent analytics, which are suited for patent owners or business competitors who are looking to gather, analyze, and assess patent validity strength before pursuing or defending patent lawsuits, advancing licensing deals, or structuring M&A transactions, DataNovo's business intelligence helps facilitate real-world settlement, licensing, and purchase negotiations.

Once business owners create a profile, add bank account info and identity confirmation, they have immediate access to create, manage, and redeem gift cards.

Our privacy and security-focused infrastructure will also allow businesses to create and buy bespoke zero-party datasets that are more accurate, more robust and ethically sourced directly from the users and sold with full user consent.

Dainese,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dainese,"AgTech, Public Safety, Retail, Sporting Goods",To advocate and deliver safety to people exposed to traumatic injuries in dynamic sports and everyday activities.,"The history of Dainese began in Molvena, Italy in 1972. Lino Dainese, a young motorcyclist and businessman, started designing and making protective clothing for bike riders. Taking inspiration from the geometry of medieval armoury and from nature itself, Dainese made technological innovation for protection during sports their true mission. To Dainese safety means protection, comfort and reliability, factors which, when properly balanced, lead to the creation of highly effective products which meet the requirements of a wide range of customer needs. Riders on track need a different balance between protection and comfort than, for instance, scooter riders. The engineers at D-Tec (Dainese Technology Center) have all the skills needed to transfer the experience gained from the extreme conditions of competitions, to create a collection of products that caters for all types of motorbike riders. Research, development and competition are therefore the essence of a journey that began more than forty years ago. From Giacomo Agostini to Valentino Rossi, Dainese became part of motorcycling with the greatest riders thanks to their invention of products like back protectors, knee sliders or the evolution of existing products with the introduction of innovative technologies and materials. It was Dainese who conceived the idea of “head-to-toe” protection which combines various clothing components with rider protection, and optimises performance and weight. It was also Dainese who created D-air®, the intelligent protection based on air bag technology for bike riders."

DateSalad is for the discerning individual who believes in quality over quantity. The name comes from our view on the way that dating should be - stimulating, pure, and poised to develop naturally or as we say in short, “crisp, fresh, and organic.” The name also speaks to the myriad of options that you have in online dating that we help you simplify to your tastes. There is that special someone for everyone. As such, we believe that when you know who you are and what works for you, you will know what you are looking for.

It is always easier to fix the problem on the very first stage and it gets harder with time so you should never put it aside and take action about it as soon as you can. Premature ejaculation has a lot to do with a subjective approach. Some men may not feel satisfied with their 10 or 15 minutes performance other can be satisfied with 3-5 minutes. However we actually talk about premature ejaculation when ejaculation time is less than two minutes. It leads to lots of serious psychological problems like distresses, depression, partner’s dissatisfaction and so on. However there is a cure and you almost hold it in your hands. Priligy is really able to improve the situation. Clinical researches show up to 400% improvement in intercourse duration. Like many other drugs Priligy was not initially used to treat ED and premature ejaculation and it was just another antidepressant until that very moment when this ‘side-effect’ was discovered and Dapoxetine, the key component, was used as a foundation for this reliable and highly effective preparation called Priligy. Several years ago it wasn’t that easy that you can just go and buy Priligy whenever you want. It was available just in a few countries but now there are no such boundaries. The Internet gives us unbelievable freedom of speech and consumption, now you can order and buy Priligy online with no need to even leave your couch. Do not set this problem aside.
