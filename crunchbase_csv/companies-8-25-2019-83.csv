ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord, leading to paralysis and an inability to speak and breath, with an average life expectancy of only 3 years from diagnosis and an age of onset averaging at 55. Recent advances in DNA sequencing of patients show that ALS can be caused by mutations in close to 30 different genes which cause multiple different sub-forms of the disease. It is therefore unlikely that all ALS patients can be treated the same way. Mutations in some of these genes also cause FTD, and thus these two diseases may be treated by similar therapies. The QurAlis strategy is to go for ALS one gene at a time. We do this by using a transformative system in which cells from ALS patients are used to model the disease in a dish to identify new drugs. Two of the founders of QurAlis, Harvard professors Kevin Eggan and Clifford Woolf have pioneered this technology for ALS resulting in the discovery of a potential new ALS drug, Ezogabine, which is being tested in a phase 2 clinical trial. QurAlis is a Cambridge based subsidiary company of Q-State Biosciences, a stem cell biotechnology company that has developed proprietary technologies for which QurAlis has the exclusive rights for use in ALS drug discovery."

When these three parameters were adjusted in a recent assessment of pharmaceutical R&D productivity (Paul et al. 2010 ) to capture the effects of using CoRE™, this translated to capitalized costs savings of $238 million and out-of-pocket cost reductions of $88 million.  Additionally, CoRE™ can quickly yield significant reductions in time which may be instrumental in gaining first mover IP advantage, particularly with novel targets.

quay.io,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/quay-io,Software,Quay.io is a private hosted docker registry.,"Quay.io was originally created out of necessity when the company wanted to use Docker containers with an original IDE product. Docker containers were being used to host and isolate server processes invoked on behalf of our users and often running their code. The project was started by building the Docker image dynamically whenever a new host node spun up. The image was monolithic. It was too large, took too long to build, and was hard to manage conflicts. It was everything that Docker wasn't supposed to be. When it was decided to split it up into pre-built images and host them somewhere, it was noticed that there wasn't a good place to host images securely. Determined to scratch the itch, Quay.io was built, and officially launched it as an aside in a presentation to the Docker New York City Meetup on October 2nd, 2013. After launch, customers demanded that Quay.io become the main focus. They rely on the company to make sure they can store and distribute their Docker images. In August, 2014, Quay.io joined CoreOS to provide registry support for the enterprise."

The change affects a company's ability to grow. It impacts revenues and profitability. It determines how well an enterprise can serve its customers, work with its partners, support its employees. Yet, surprisingly, it is often overlooked by top executives. Quite simply, communications services have become mission critical. Voice, data, cellular, local, long distance, Internet access, DSL, VPN, calling cards, PBX, voice mail, unified messaging, network management, broadband access – these services are the lifeblood of any enterprise that wants to tackle global markets, innovate at Internet speed, and engage in the continuous transformation that is demanded by today's competitive environment. Unfortunately, the process of procuring and managing them has become increasingly chaotic and costly. Communications has become the third largest operational expense in mid-size companies. Even at that expense, much of it remains hidden, scattered throughout the enterprise, distributed among the business units, duplicated by mergers and acquisitions. Communications managers find themselves inundated with a mind-numbing array of service options, overwhelmed with literally boxes of bills, and continually asking for more headcount. Managing these multiple vendors diverts critical resources away from core business initiatives. Billing errors reduce funding for research, product development, marketing, and sales.
