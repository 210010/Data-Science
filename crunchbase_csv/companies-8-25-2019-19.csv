We believe we offer a solution in the API space that is not just an incremental improvement over our competitors, but a significant leap in terms of the amount of time, headaches, and developer resources we will save you. Our platform incorporates more than a decade of deep experience involving how to securely build, deploy, and manage service-based applications in the enterprise. Dreamfactory can be installed on any server, connected to any SQL or NoSQL database, and used for developing HTML5 or native mobile applications. Our technology enables developers to build modern applications for the phone, tablet, or desktop without having to manage server-side code and complexity. - Dreamfactory has innovated beyond this technology to be able to connect to anything instantly and provide a fully reusable, standardized REST API with full documentation. You do not need to rely on the DreamFactory engineering roadmap to handle emergent technologies - we will not be a bottleneck (nor try to gouge you for Non-Recurring Engineering fees to build a new connection) for your API needs. - Dreamfactory also uses this REST API auto-generation to integrate anything almost instantly, completely on-premise, so that you can achieve complete IT environment homogenization inside a couple of months. This is achieved through the standardized way that APIs are deployed, meaning you are eliminating backend complexity for your development teams. - If RESTification is the way forward for you, DreamFactory is the fastest and most enterprise-friendly way of doing it, because you get unlimited connections with a Dreamfactory license for significantly less cost; hence, you can scale Dreamfactory across your organization in a way that SnapLogic cannot. - Dreamfactory additionally has unique API Orchestration capabilities that allow you to raise your team’s data quality through allowing you to combine data from different data sources, or combine data from different tables within the same data source, with a single API call. This capability offers a new best practice in enterprise gateways. - Finally, we have GraphQL autogeneration just around the corner and have new security updates about to be released that will make Dreamfactory the most secure API Management solution. We were built from the ground up based on the frustrations with the learning curve required for API solutions like Mulesoft and SnapLogic - and is why we have clients like McKesson (#6 on the Fortune 500 list) stating that Dreamfactory is significantly easier and cheaper than [major competitor], and wishing they found us sooner."

DropWise Technologies,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dropwise-technologies,"Advanced Materials, Biotechnology, Energy Efficiency, Manufacturing, Renewable Energy, Solar",DropWise provides a breakthrough coating technology invented at MIT to protect industrial equipment from fouling and corrosion.,"DropWise Technologies Corp. is commercializing a breakthrough coating technology, including advanced durable materials and unique vapor-based deposition processes developed in collaboration between two leading MIT labs, to solve problems of fouling and corrosion in heat exchange equipment. By applying its innovative ultra-thin and durable coating solutions, DropWise serves enormous markets that were previously inaccessible by conventional coating technologies. Heat exchangers are a crucial part of every thermal fluid system, from the intercoolers and radiators used to cool cars and trucks, to the condensers and evaporators that drive HVAC/R equipment, to the massive boilers and condensers that drive manufacturing processes and power plants. They rely on very thin heat transfer surfaces that are extremely sensitive to fouling and corrosion, which creates a process bottleneck and forces operators to either reduce output capacity, consume more energy to compensate, or shut down completely to clean the affected heat exchanger.  For all of these problems, conventional liquid-based anti-fouling and anti-corrosion coatings are too thick, and often make the problem worse by insulating the heat transfer surfaces. Faced with this unacceptable performance tradeoff, the status quo is to leave the equipment uncoated and to bear the significant costs of the fouling and corrosion that inevitably occur. Using an innovative vapor-based deposition process, DropWise coatings are chemically grafted to virtually any surface and built up to precise thicknesses. The chemical grafting provides an extremely durable bond that has surpassed testing under severe industrial conditions, and the coating thicknesses can be tuned to nanometer precision to be hundreds of times thinner than conventional coatings. DropWise has secured a license to the MIT patent applications, and is developing a coating platform built from a wide library of precursor materials to address different applications. Low surface energy coatings are used to break up insulating films of condensate into droplets, enabling a 7x increase in heat transfer that allows the coating to boost the efficiency of a wide range of processes, from steam power generation and desalination to HVAC/R and chemical processing; while another chemically inert formulation is used to protect against corrosive environments."

The first Ecommerce CRM - ECRM - is built to drive sales, not sales teams. ","Marketing automation isn’t personal. We knew that when we started Drip in 2013. Automation can make your marketing appear personal. It can help make it feel more human, but algorithms using machine learning, big data, and artificial intelligence, will end up feeling exactly like that… Artificial. In today’s Amazon-ified, data scraping world, your customers begrudgingly accept trade-offs between selection, price, convenience, and “personalization” They will give away some data to get back other benefits. And that’s ok, until it isn’t... Without careful attention to detail and context, big data-driven personalization can feel more like the stalking of Big Brother than the future of retail. And to your customers—who are increasingly savvy about tracking (and therefore increasingly wary)—that means Big has become a bother—not a boon. Big tags you. Big targets you. Big mass markets at you. Big lumps you in with a bunch of people it thinks are exactly like you, and then Big tries to manipulate you. But Big is clumsy, dense, and lacks nuance. Big doesn’t care enough to remember who you are. And ironically, by missing the little details, Big misses the big picture. Your customers shop with you because you’re not Big. Because you provide a smarter, more tailor-made experience. They’re not impressed by your algorithms, they’re interested in your genuine knowledge. Knowledge about the product and service, and knowledge about them, the customer. To win their loyalty, you have to earn their trust. Which starts by showing you care enough about them to remember who they are. So, how do you do that? Don’t go Big. At Drip, our focus is on increasing sales for companies looking to build mutually beneficial relationships with B2C customers. It’s the first CRM resource built by and for ecommerce specifically. We call it ECRM and it’s a whole new way to build better, mutually-beneficial relationships with your customers at scale. It’s still true that marketing automation isn’t personal...yet. Drip is focused on continuing to define ECRM beyond its current limitations, through product evolution focused on your distinct needs and opportunities. The goal is to connect your order management system with your marketing system at the customer level in order to build better, more profitable, and real relationships with your customers. It’s a big opportunity for all of us, and that’s the kind of Big we are happy to embrace. – The Drip Team"

Dream Harvest Ltd,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dream-harvest-ltd,"Digital Entertainment, Gaming",Dream Harvest is a games development studio that makes genre blended games for the core market.,"Dream Harvest was founded by Justin French, previously an Audio Engineer who had spent 5 years working in the music industry before making the transition to the AAA and indie games industry. The company was formed in April 2013. 2 months were spent building an experienced team of developers, designers and artists. Our first project, Erosion: The Game That Rocks was a test bed to see how the team would gel. We worked on the project, part time, for 3 months and then put the project on hold as our artist at the time became inundated with freelance work.  We brought on a new artist and began work prototyping and designing a game for the band Enter Shikari. The game was a mobile tower defence game that combined traditional tower defence mechanics with MOBA like hero characters (which were the 4 band members). The game was set within festival grounds and had a variety of enemy types that linked in with the lyrics of the band’s music and political ethos and allowed players to build towers that were your traditional festival props such as merch stands, triage tents, the dreaded festival toilets, etc. Players were able to control each of the 4 band members who each had their own sets of abilities and strengths and weaknesses.  Unfortunately, the project was put on hold when Enter Shikari’s management, due to their commitment to their 4th album recording which was due to begin soon, decided that the band’s focus and energy should be within the music only and not within cross media projects, even with protests from the band themselves.  We were of course quite disappointed, especially as we had spent almost 6 months in pre-production and were under the assumption that the project would get the go ahead. We hope to return to this project down the line and see if Enter Shikari’s management has warmed up to the idea and potential of cross media projects. We then began work on a cyberpunk stealth / action game named The Tower. We spent 6 months documenting and prototyping ideas before going into production of a demo level. During this time our artist unfortunately had to leave us due to pressure from his full time job at Good Game Studios. We were left without an artist for the second time and with a team in quite a demotivated state due to our streak of bad luck. But through it all the core team stuck together and with our new predicament of not having an artist we decided to conduct an internal game jam where each of the four core team members would work on a prototype for 3 weeks and the game that we, as a team, thought to be most interesting and commercially viable would be turned into a full game.  Failure was born. At first as a 2D puzzle strategy game developed in a custom engine where players needed to place and remove cubes on a square grid level to alter the behaviour of Ai controlled units and ultimately kill all the enemy units; and now a full 3D RTS game with a complex layer of player hacking abilities, multiple unit types and buildings and a unique resource management system all centred around the original Ai controlled unit and indirect behavioural interaction concept. Since production began on Failure we have received incredibly positive feedback from people throughout the industry including ex-creative Director at Maxis, Ray Mazza as well as a number of professional Star Craft 2 players. We realised early on that we were onto something special with Failure, an opportunity to bring together the current trends in E-sports gaming along with love of the Cyberpunk themes and RTS and CCG genres all packaged together with a unique singleplayer and multiplayer narrative, combined using a procedural narrative system that takes into account player actions."

Now I have it, I’m in love with it. I am in project management, so on top of managing myself I have to manage a lot of others. While I have to-do systems such as Trello and Asana, most of those to-dos are spurred from emails (or an email that has a lot of information)."" ""I’ve tried setting up folders and didn’t work. It made it so hard until now. Drag, simply put, is awesome. I can now run my inbox like I do my tasks inside Trello.” “We’ve previously used tools such as Wunderlist, Asana, Evernote, Todoist, Any.do, Trello and Sortd however they’re all focused on managing Tasks inside a tool. I need to manage my tasks inside my email. Booooom, then Drag came a long. Honestly, it’s the most productive Chrome extension I’ve used in years. Thanks Drag, I’m an official Dragster now!” “Email is the perennial problem for me, because I want to use it as a todo list, but I also want a zero inbox. I’m a huge fan of Trello, it is the most productive workspace I have today.  So when I saw Drag, the light went on and I am now unable to live without it.” “We’ve tried them all from Trello, Asana, Evernote through to Sortd and others. Drag complements my use of Trello perfectly. I don’t want all Tasks inside Trello so to run my Gmail separately works amazingly well.” How does Drag compare to other tools?  If you’re considering what Task Management or Project Management tools you should be using in your spare time and improve what you’re doing, there’s a lot of options.  From regular old spreadsheets to manage Tasks to specific Kanban boards of software, sales and marketing. There are dozens of solutions (we love Trello) and Drag works perfectly with them. Don’t replace your main tools, instead use Drag to apply the same principles of being efficient with tasks, inside your inbox.  www.dragapp.com "
