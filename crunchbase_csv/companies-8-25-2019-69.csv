Net Reviews,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/net-reviews,"Information Technology, Internet, Professional Services",Net Reviews SAS created an international solution specialised in the collection and publication of customer’s reviews.,"Founded in April 2012 by Olivier Mouillet, Laurent Abisset and Tom Brami, Verified Reviews is the solution developed by Net Reviews to guarantee that customer reviews are genuine. Fake reviews published on websites are now a thing of the past. Avis Vérifiés guarantees trustworthiness. How? By collecting feedback from customers who have actually had an experience with a particular store, by enabling a dialog between company and customer during the moderation phase, and by displaying genuine customer reviews as a result of this process. In a few short years, Avis Vérifiés has established itself as the leader in customer reviews in France. With an international team of 60, Avis Vérifiés boasts a 5,000-strong client base including many major French players such as oui.sncf, SFR, Bricorama, and But. Between 2014 and 2017, the company’s revenue increased fivefold.  **Avis Vérifiés: from Marseille-based startup to French leader of customer-review gathering** Who has never looked up reviews by other web users before buying a product online? 85% of web users read customer reviews before making a purchase online and 91% of those who read reviews consider them to be the number 1 factor influencing their decision to buy. Customer testimonials play a key role in the act of purchasing and have a big impact on the e-reputation of brands. And yet, according to an investigation conducted by France’s General Directorate for Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) in 2016, 35% of reviews published online are fake. To put it plainly, one out of three times someone will have left a comment about a restaurant they have never been to or rated a product they have never bought. That’s where Avis Vérifiés steps in. Avis Vérifiés is certified as compliant with the French national standard for service (NF Service). It offers a solution to gather website reviews (online shopping experience), product reviews, but also store reviews (experience in brick-and-mortar stores). The solution centers on 3 complementary services: *   Review gathering:  Avis Vérifiés sends a personalized email to all customers – with no pre-selection – to request a review submission. The reviews are gathered from customers who have been  authenticated via a proof of purchase. *   Moderation: It offers web merchants the possibility of responding to and dealing with a customer’s issue before their review is published.  *   Review display: All reviews are published, whether they are positive or negative. Web merchants cannot modify or delete comments. By default, reviews are displayed from most recent to oldest. **A solution that is spreading across Europe and the American markets** 6 years after its creation in 2012, Avis Vérifiés now boasts a team of 60 employees. In Europe, the Marseille-based head office is backed up by the Madrid and Berlin offices. In the United States, the development of the North and South American markets is managed from a subsidiary opened in Miami, an office in Boston. This development will now gather speed with the acquisition of Trusted Company in Brazil which positions Avis Vérifiés as the market leader in South America.  The solution is also deployed in Italy, Portugal, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. In each country its name is translated into the local language (Avis Vérifiés, Opiniones Verificadas…).   **Exceptional growth recognized by different awards and rankings ** Net Reviews, which publishes the Avis Vérifiés solution, is ranked 38th by Deloitte in its national Technology Fast 50 ranking (France) and is in the 170th place in the FAST 500 EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa), which recognizes the top 500 companies with the highest growth rate in this region.

The core element of NevadaNano’s sensor modules and systems is manufactured on a solid-state, MEMS technology, offering small size, low cost, and high reliability. The sensing element is an array of MEMS structures that are not only self-activating and self-sensing, they are also self-cleaning and self-calibrating, thus enabling unattended deployment for extended periods. Using proprietary materials as well as unique sensing methods and analysis techniques, a single sensor configuration is able to detect hundreds of diverse types of vapors and particles.

NewsBox is also integrating with other social networks, giving users the ability to share content and push to those networks, which creates a central repository for content distribution.  As a destination site, NewsBox helps fill the need for quality platforms to publish native content.  Unlike competing products, we are on-boarding readers while also integrating with a large number of popular platforms to extend reach.   NewsBox gathers data from across the web, and from publishers publishing on the platform, to provide a hub of media intelligence.  Our unique media monitoring can provide mentions, trends, sentiment and other valuable data that goes beyond free keyword alert systems.  Our up-and-coming insights and analytics will provide valuable dashboards for various users in a number of verticals, including healthcare/pharma, legal, and entertainment, while also addressing the needs of the departments within companies and organizations that our users represent. Problems: Reputation management Cost justify quality content creation Cluttered platforms Reach targeted readers Premium subscription options Read.  Publish.  Monitor.   NewsBox is an affordable, cloud-based SaaS solution that combines the best elements of popular PR software, social media monitoring tools, content distribution and business intelligence systems into a single platform useful to various departments within a business.  It is a stable, mature, fully supported platform.  The NewsBox solution helps companies manage paid, earned, and owned media on a single platform, providing options to advertise, reach journalists and influencers, and integrate data, widgets, and tools into existing websites and other media. NewsBox provides comprehensive, yet affordable, media monitoring while delivering more value than simple key-word tools or news readers.  Search engines index web content regularly, but they often don't catch content immediately after publication, especially from lesser known long-tail publishers and blogs, and they don't have access to premium content behind the paywall.   NewsBox media intelligence platform helps businesses reduce risk and associated costs, and provides a faster, more organized solution for the information worker to manage media mentions and following content of importance. Every company has a brand.  Online content affects the company’s ability to attract and maintain customers and talent.  The company’s brand can be over 70% of the company’s value.  The old way of monitoring media mentions was to manually save newspaper and magazine clippings, or hire a PR company to compile.   NewsBox is a great option for anyone to self-manage their online PR but is ideal for ad agencies, PR firms, professional service firms and corporations.  PR firms can use NewsBox for online brand management.  Marketing departments can use it to publish native content for inbound marketing and measure ROI.  Management can use NewsBox to stay on top of competitors, follow influencers and stay current on industry news from a broad range of top publications. NewsBox is an intelligent alternative to current outdated newsletter solutions.  Newsletters account for over 65% of marketing e-mails sent.  NewsBox gives publishers the ability to reach readers without e-mail yet still includes e-mail for non-NewsBox members.  By using less e-mail, NewsBox reduces spam and the associated likelihood content will not reach a reader’s inbox.  Users can host high-resolution graphics on NewsBox instead of adding them to e-mail and risk being stopped by firewalls and e-mail filters.   [*] SaaS companies; instead of developing and marketing downloads or disks, offer software online as a subscription service. "

Fast forward a few years: today NextBee is the leading marketing promotions platform for businesses with a social–media-savvy audience.  As a bootstrapped and profitable company with relentless focus on organic growth, we have never sponsored a conference nor run a jazzy ad campaign.

Both acquisitions allowed Netrepid the opportunity to increase its capabilities in the area of managed IT services for residents and small businesses in the Central PA-area.  Today, Netrepid provides enterprise class infrastructure hosting services for a large variety of industries including the professional services industry, manufacturers, transportation and logistics providers, and companies involved in all areas of the supply chain.

Neuron Guard,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/neuron-guard,"Health Care, Manufacturing, Medical Device",Neuron Guard is developing a medical device the new standard of care for targeted temperature management of brain damages. ,"Neuron Guard, recognized as the best European startup in HEALTH category (Startup Europe Awards - SEUA 2017), is developing a life-saving medical device that aims to become the standard of care for Targeted Temperature Management (TTM) therapy.  Every 7 seconds around the world a person suffers of Acute Brain Damage because of Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). They are the most costly and prevalent killers in the last 15 years (15 million deaths by CVD in 2015), and the leading cause of disability (the global incidence rate of TBI is 200 per 100k people per year). WHO estimated a global expenditure of $ 330 billion in 2015, but it is going to increase sharply: $ 4 trillion in 2025 - including premature death, disability, and health care costs - just for CVD in LMICs.  Temperature is a vital body parameter. It regulates all cellular functions so its management is essential for the good outcome of patients in several medical conditions such as cardiac arrest, stroke, traumatic brain injury, neuro and cardiac surgery, epilepsy, migraine and oncology. Regulating body temperature at a desired level makes all other treatments more effective. The most modern medical approach is the target temperature management, where physicians try to maintain the most favourable temperature for the patient for up to 24-36 hours, preventing excessive warming (fever) or cooling. Our device is a targeted temperature management system composed by a THERAPEUTIC COLLAR POWERED BY A SMART CONTROL UNIT (the size of a small briefcase). The collar transforms the neck into a natural heat exchanger exploiting several physiological and anatomical characteristics of the human body. It is quicker to act on brain tissue but can also function as total body temperature adjusting device if required. A disposable protective shield makes cleaning the collar after each use simple while featuring an optimal safety profile both in term of pathogens and allergens. The control unit collects all the data of the treatment and transmits them to the Emergency Response System.  Our mission is to improve the safety of patients on the roadside, at home or in the workplace, and to reduce the costs of chronic care. In fact, Neuron Guard aims to be the only device that can be used in every circumstance, inside and outside the hospital, and allow the user to fully manage the temperature of the patient warming and cooling as necessary.  Our vision is to have a Neuron Guard kit in every public place just like the Automatic External Defibrillator (AED) to empower bystanders to immediately react in case of emergency. Under this perspective our device becomes a connected-intelligent platform that takes care of the patient, connects the scene with the Emergency Response System transmitting vital data to improve the readiness and effectiveness of professional intervention. The device is patented in Italy, USA and China. We have made several prototypes in collaboration with Italian and English companies, such as Tecno Elettra Impianti and TWI, tested it in laboratory and published the experimental results on the NeuroCritical Care Journal. We have also conducted a GAP Analysis with another English consulting firm (CDP) and we are testing the human prototype internally.  We are seeking to raise 2.5M€ to complete the pre-industrialization, with design and construction of the human device for the pilot trial, finalized the regulatory clearance and launch it into the market in 2019."

With retired Air Force Brigadier General Dick Lassiter serving as president and chairman of the board – not to mention founding partners such as entertainers James Stewart and Arthur Godfrey – They were in quite capable hands right from the start.

In the following years, They grew steadily and constantly looked for new ways to ensure They provided the best safety and service for Their Owners: new aircraft, new facilities, new global programs. In 1995, Warren Buffett joined NetJets as a customer; by 1998, he was so impressed with the operation that he bought the company, adding it to the Berkshire Hathaway empire.
