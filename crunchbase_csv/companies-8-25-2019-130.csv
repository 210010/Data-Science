Zopa,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zopa,"Finance, FinTech, Lending, Peer to Peer","Zopa offers peer-to-peer loans with low rates, flexible terms, and no early repayment fees.","Zopa is a P2P money lending service that allows lenders and borrowers to deal directly with one another, cutting out the banks who act as middlemen. Zopa works in the following way: the company first categorizes borrower credit grades with an A*, A, B, C or Y rating; then lenders make offers that vary by money amount and time period for persons with a certain credit grade, and borrowers can then agree the aggregate offered rate. Zopa takes on such responsibilities as distributing money between parties, completing the legal paperwork, performing borrower identity/credit checks, and employing a collections agency that chases missed payments for the lender. Zopa also mitigates risk for lenders by enforcing monthly direct debit repayment, making borrowers sign a legal contract, and allowing lenders to lend small chunks of money to individual borrowers (i.e. someone lending Â£1000 would have their money spread across say, 100 borrowers). The company itself makes money by charging a fixed fee for borrowers and a 1% annual fee for lenders. Zopa has received public acclaim as well, having been awarded CNET Technology Awards' 2006 Internet Innovation of the Year, the 2007 Webby Award for Best Banking/Bill-Paying Website, the 2008 Webby Award for Financial Services, the Banker 2007 Award for Best Internet Project and Moneywise 2009 Awards for Best Customer Service and Best Personal Loan.

Their Company is addressing the core technology of a massive industry at the heart of the modern economy. SMR is the dominant process worldwide for the production of hydrogen and its derivatives, representing about $50 billion/yr of capital and operating costs. Oil refining, ammonia for fertilizers, direct reduced iron (DRI) from iron ore, and methanol production all use the SMR process. They estimate that if their reactor technology were applied to all of the new SMR production capacity projected to be built in the hydrogen, ammonia, and DRI segments in the next ten years, the net value of the capital and energy savings relative to the next best technology alternatives would be $6.0Bn. If their Company’s reactor technology were applied to half of the existing hydrogen, ammonia, and DRI SMR plants, expanding their capacity by 25%, the value relative to the use of the best alternative technology would be $13Bn."

The idea for Zoodles was born while Mark watched his 4-year-old daughter, Abbie, struggle while using the computer. He wondered why kids were constantly trying to adapt to computers rather than having the computers adapt to them. After talking with dozens of other parents, it became clear that they were all equally frustrated with the experiences their children were having online. While parents universally believed that the computer could help their kids learn, they just didn't have the time or resources to scour the web and find any of this fun, educational content themselves. Additionally, parents wanted more say over what their children were doing online. Without trusted content, they really didn't want to open up the whole, sometimes scary, web to their young kids. Mark decided it was time to build a safe, fun, and educational online experience for kids that also gave parents the information and control they wanted. After discussing the idea with his friend, Rich, they decided to form a company to build Zoodles. â€¨ Since then, the team has grown to include incredibly talented engineers, educational experts, and creative designers who understand how to build simple interfaces for kids. The team is excited to be working on a product that can change how children learn while giving parents an active role in the experience. We hope that you enjoy Zoodles as much as we do! â€¨"

Traditional Wi-Fi location solutions have relied upon the use of multiple access points, whose (typically omni-directional) radiation patterns overlap to cover the same physical space.  This is somewhat wasteful in product and installation costs as it is only required for geolocation (and not communication).  ZoneArt’s solution requires only a single access point to accurately locate users or objects, with accuracies measured in centimetres and not metres, essentially in real-time.  In other words a single ZoneArt access point can accurately locate in space-time. Furthermore, ZoneArt’s solution does not require a user to download any apps or even sign-in to an access point (although both could be incorporated, into a solution). Any user, with Wi-Fi enabled on their device, can be tracked, anonymously, providing useful analytics, such as routes taken through stores or malls, locations of queues and time spent queueing, etc.  Such data is invaluable to a system owner, as it can be used to price store locations in a mall, or to determine where in a store to place special offers or high-profit items."

We've been learning in the same way since the Industrial Revolution: everyone learning the same things at the same time and pace. That's why 83% of students find schools boring, and 79% of them don't understand how going to school will help them in real life. We need to better prepare our kids to a future where half of our jobs will be automated by machines. With Zoonk, kids can learn by creating their own stories or by playing stories about things they like (e.g. sports, movies, etc.). That way, they have two of the best options for learning: by playing or by creating something, which places them as protagonists rather than just memorizing information to pass exams. Teachers can use Zoonk to improve their learning experiences. They can teach and ask students to create a story about the subject taught in the classroom. Then, students can play (and discuss) each other's stories. Teachers can also create their own stories to bring students a more interactive way to explain a subject. They can also have a report to understand every student's strengths and weaknesses, providing a more personalized learning experience to each one of them. Schools can make use of those reports to optimize their resources as they can see what's working in every classroom and what needs to be improved. For school networks and the government, our data analysis can help on budgetary decisions. For example, let's say students in California perform well on Arts but badly in Science. Then, they can adjust their budget accordingly instead of spending billions of dollars per year without having detailed ways for measuring students' performance. Parents can also use Zoonk to help their kids express their creativity. It's a fun way to teach (and bond) with children."

This is done all the time within the industry, especially if a potential home buyer is looking outside the first broker's immediate geographical area of expertise. For example, a broker in San Mateo might sends business to another broker in Denver,and collect a referral fee of a few thousand dollars if the customer ends up buying a property there. Brokers will be able to establish their real-estate cred by blogging on their profile pages. Each transaction also generates a reputation score similar to eBay's. (Not only can the brokers vote on each other's reputations, but so can the home buyers or other customers involved). By automating such referrals, founder Brian Wilson thinks that he can create a system where real estate professionals can tap into each others' detailed knowledge of their own markets to counter the Zillows of the world. Other companies in the real estate space include [Zillow](http://crunchbase.com/organization/zillow) and [Redfin](http://crunchbase.com/organization/redfin)."

Zoom Teeth Whitening Delhi,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zoom-teeth-whitening-delhi,"Dental, Health Care",Zoom Teeth Whitening is a clinic that provides various dental and skin procedures to patients.,"Almost anyone can benefit from teeth whitening; however there are many reasons for discoloration and not everyone will experience the same results. That's why it's important to involve a dentist that understands your dental health history. There are many factors that play into what kind of whitening is right for you, and we will help you get the best results possible.

What are the differences of Zoom! teeth whitening with the traditional whitening where whitening trays are used? Zoom! is a procedure done under the supervision of a dentist. Zoom! is particularly advantageous since it involves only one treatment. You can get your Zoom! whitening done during your lunch break. The results of Zoom! whitening are immediate, giving you a sparkling smile in about an hour. Zoom! whitens teeth far quicker compared to whitening trays and strips. How does Zoom! whitening work? Zoom! is a very simple procedure. After a brief cleaning of your teeth, and isolation of your gums and cheeks, a peroxide-based gel is applied on your teeth. In order to activate the gel, a special light is used which will accelerate the whitening process. The action of the gel and the light together on your teeth significantly reduces the time it takes to whiten.  The Zoom! light is applied in three 15-20 minute intervals depending your specific condition and whitening requirements. We  will be happy to explain the Zoom! process.  Who are good candidates for Zoom? Not everyone is a good candidate for zoom whitening. If you consider Zoom as an option to give you an instant makeover, our in house dentist will examine your teeth to make sure no serious conditions, such as cavities or decay or existing periodontal disease are already present. In those cases these immediate problems are to be addressed before Zoom!. After care 48 to 72 hours after the treatment, you should avoid any sort of staining food or drink, especially wine, coffee, tea, and cigarettes. If you feel sensitivity with your teeth, you can use over the counter toothpastes that are recommended to reduce the teeth sensitivity. The Zoom ! Whitespeed In-Office Whitening System is a revolutionary tooth whitening procedure. It's safe effective and very fast. In just under an hour, your teeth will be dramatically whiter. Zoom ! Whitening is ideal for anyone looking for immediate results. The convenience of Zoom ! in comparison to days of wearing trays and gradual whitening makes it the perfect choice for the busy patient. The Zoom ! light activated gel was developed after years of research by Discus Dental, the leaders in professional take-home tooth whitening. The gel is a scientifically formulated, pH balanced Hydrogen Peroxide that, when activated by the Zoom ! light, gently penetrates the teeth to remove deep stains and discoloration. With proper care and an occasional touch-up at home, your whiter smile will sparkle for a long time. Requirements Prior to Zoom! Treatment All patients will require a limited examination prior to proceeding with ZOOM whitening treatment, including review of medical and dental history. Examination will evaluate whether dental disease, such as periodontal disease, abscesses or cavities, are present. If such disease is found, it must be treated prior to proceeding with whitening treatment because worsening of disease may occur and/or patient may experience pain or increased post- operative sensitivity. Patients must have had a cleaning within the last 6 months to ensure a clean tooth surface is present for optimal results and safe and effective treatment is performed around healthy gums.   Your risks and benefits will be discussed with you prior to commencing treatment. ZOOM whitening can only be performed on children 18 years or older, except with parental consent and following examination to ensure dental safety. Tooth whitening is not recommended for women who are pregnant or breast feeding, patients currently treated for a serious illness or disorder, light sensitive individuals including those on PUVA or other photo-chemotherapy, and those taking any photo-reactive drugs or substances, whether over-the-counter, prescription or homeopathic. Our doctor will determine if you are a good candidate."
