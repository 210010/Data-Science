Their platform allows internal teams to achieve 100% automation of dispute management by aggregating data from multiple disparate vendors and running it through rules-based workflows and machine learning. 3 Key Benefits  - Lower Overall Dispute Rate  - Improved Dispute Win Rate  - Less Time Wasted Managing Disputes  Our Approach The Chargeback App aggregates your processor, gateway, and sales data (customer, product, shipping, and usage) as well as issuer alerts into a single portal. This allows Chargeback to combat the fraudulent use of chargeback rights in real-time and allows your team to quickly take meaningful action such as issuing refunds, blocking orders, preventing fulfillment, rerouting shipments, and generating dispute responses with minimal effort. Lowering Your Dispute Ratio with Real-time Resolution  Through the Chargeback App, merchants benefit from Real-time Resolution. This feature provides customer, product, shipping and usage detail to the dispute analyst at the cardholder’s issuing bank at the start of the dispute lifecycle. With this enhanced level of detail, the issuer is equipped to decide if the cardholder should file a dispute. This level of customer, order and product detail is normally not available until well into the dispute process. With Chargeback’s Real-time Resolution feature, it becomes the first line of defense and stops the dispute from ever becoming a chargeback.  Improving Your Dispute Win Rate with Best Practices and Expertise  The Chargeback App is used to manage all types of disputes and facilitates quick and comprehensive response generation for all categories of disputes including, Fraud, Authorization, Processing Errors, and Cardholder Disputes. Much of the response data will auto-populate from connected data sources into contextual evidence blocks written to address and adhere to the network’s rules and regulations. The Chargeback App guides users through the addition of required and/or supplemental compelling evidence based on the network reason code, transaction type and any applicable transaction modifiers to ensure the best possible responses are provided to the issuer and ensuring the highest possible win-rates. Reducing Time Spent Managing Disputes  Identifying and gathering the data required to respond to a single dispute traditionally requires logging into several separate systems, including OMS, CRM, ERP, fraud filters, shipping vendors and multiple PSPs (gateways, processors, networks). By consolidating the data from each, the Chargeback App eliminates the excessive time traditionally spent dealing with a dispute. By programming the dispute rules set forth by each network (Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover) your team no longer needs to research and understand the nuances of reason codes, transaction modifiers and exceptions necessary to properly respond to disputes. The Chargeback App provides expert guidance and support at every stage of the dispute lifecycle to ensure the recovery of lost revenue."

The learner is accompanied by Professor Max, the learners’ private language teacher and together they build a time machine to travel back in time to fix the world. Daily challenges, boss fights and a personalised learning route make the learner incredibly motivated.  Hi, my name is Attila AlGharawi. I’m the James Bond of language teachers, the co-founder and CEO of Xeropan. We develop the revolution of language learning with a team of 15 in the heart of Debrecen. The latest version of our app has been downloaded more 30.000 times in the last 5 weeks since our launch. Let me tell you the motivation and the personal story of me and my business partner. I’m a language teacher and have run my own language studio for more than 10 years. This is where I first met my business partner. He was one of my students. He’s a 38-year-old successful business man with an organisation of 600 full time employees, on the other hand he still struggled as an English student and was unable to apply what he learned in business scenarios with the traditional methods of learning. This wasn’t his fault. With my inspiration, he managed to break down his barriers and we together set a goal of revolutionising language education and developing the Siri of language learning. Just picture it, you have a digital language teacher with whom you can have a chat on various topics. Professor Max corrects you, motivates and helps you, like a native language teacher. He keeps buzzing in your ear to make you fight for your goal. According UNESCO’s 2014 research, there’re more than 2 billion language learners worldwide. Xeropan currently offers a solution to a 200-million-large market in Hungarian, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese and Hindi. Xeropan is available for download for free from the Stores. Xeropan is the creator and the seller and the learner is the buyer of the premium learning content through an in-game credit called Xeropan coins that can be purchased from the App Store and Google Play. We’re now looking to raise education-related smart investment to fast-track our revenue and growth in the target countries."

XOTAR,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/xotar,"Artificial Intelligence, Automotive, Autonomous Vehicles, Computer Vision, Drones, Embedded Systems, Robotics",Domain Specific ProcessingTechnology for Autonomous Robots/Vehicles,"XOTAR is focused on delivering trustworthy AI for autonomous robots. The company is developing a full stack integrated software and hardware platform for Autonomous Robots in the form of a reference architecture consisting of a cloud-based simulator and distributed, embedded sensing and control system (super-controller). The reference architecture approach is designed to coordinate value in the industrial ecosystem (sensor, actuator and vehicle manufacturers). XOTAR has a rigorous and transparent approach to functional specification, training, verification and testing of the cognitive and perceptual functionalities required for safety critical autonomous systems.  Trustworthy autonomous systems require advanced knowledge of environments in which the robot performs missions (including static and dynamic interactions), in addition to human defined directives for performing. Ultimately the robots need to be trained to perform in a trustworthy manner and learning involves risks that are unacceptable since an element of exploration is required. Simulation is a means to provide the ability to learn optimal and safe behaviors/skills without threatening the environment or people, animals etc. Modelling simulations with the fidelity of real environments is difficult however. XOTAR addresses this by a technology that reconstructs natural environments in a synthetic representation. Our goal is to achieve a synthetic representation of typical environments that the control software cannot distinguish from natural environments.  This achievement will allow massive simulation and training while also ensuring that the skills acquired will apply to the real world. The promise is safer, higher competence, verified perception, reasoning and motor skills. According to XOTAR's approach, simulation will be used extensively before real-world testing/validation/verification is performed with its associated risks to life."

With our site they can see which local retailers carry the products they are looking for and can purchase them directly on our site or just go to the nearest shop and get it. Mission Statement: XION’s mission is to create the best consumer shopping experience. Why We’re Doing This: Dan Fairbanks started XION because when he was operating his own specialty running stores and e-commerce site he got really fed up with the bad software he was using. Dan couldn't find a software solution that truly made my life easier as a small retailer. He knew there had to be a better way. Dan teamed up with Robert Ivie, a veteran software engineer, and together they are building the future of omni-channel retailing. Team: Dan Fairbanks - CEO - Dan graduated from BYU with a degree in entrepreneurship in 2009. Dan started and operated his own running stores and e-commerce website for 4 years in the Seattle area. He then went to a coding bootcamp to learn iOS development, which he did professionally for 2 years before starting XION. Dan was in the first Startup Ignition cohort where he applied the lean startup methodology to validate his ideas with customers. Dan has a knack for great UI/UX design and will hustle to do whatever needs to be done to make XION a success. Robert Ivie - CTO - Robert is a veteran programmer who can get a lot done quickly. He excels solving complex problems and works really well in teams. Robert has worked for big companies and startups alike including Ancestry, ProPay, Powercode, and FamilySearch. Robert has turned down CTO offers at other companies to work on XION because he believes in XION’s mission."
