WeConvene was born out of first hand experience and frustration with the manual investor access workflows. WeConvene is a global SaaS platform that connects all three sides of the capital markets. Our platform is available to Corporates, investment banks, IR firms, brokers, independent research providers and professional investors/Asset managers.

To accomplish these goals, the organization operates WE Schools and WE Day in Canada, the United States and the UK as well as WE Villages around the world.. History The WE Charity concept was hatched when the 12-year-old Craig Kielburger read a story about another 12-year-old, Iqbal Masih, who was murdered on account of his outspoken protest of child slave labor in Pakistani carpet mills. Realizing that someone of any age had the power to be an agent for change, Kielburger was inspired by Masih's story, which sparked his passion for saving children from slavery and exploitation. Kielburger convinced some of his seventh-grade classmates to join him in his quest to end child labor and established Free the Children, which would later become WE Charity.  Craig and his brother soon discovered, though, that there were many barriers to self-actualization and personal empowerment other than slave labor. Children still needed to work to support their families even after being freed from slave mills. It was clear that there were more fundamental issues at play and that a more comprehensive approach was necessary. The Five Pillars of Impact The brothers thus created WE Villages to enable entire communities to emerge from poverty. WE Villages has what it calls five Pillars of Impact, education, : health care, food security, clean water and sanitation, and alternative income.  WE Charity’s collaborative and holistic approach to assisting communities has created legacies of long-term success. By carefully addressing each one of the five pillars, WE Charity is successfully rewriting the destinies of many impoverished communities around the world. Here are just a few success stories: *The Oleleshwa Farm in Kenya has produced enough food to create more than two million meals. The farm was recently expanded to 200 acres and 12 greenhouses, student lunch programs are using the farm's produce, and important agricultural training is being provided to community leaders. *Two wells were repaired in Udawad, India in 2014. More than 800 families now have access to clean water, even during the dry season. *Girls in Chimborazo, Ecuador have been participating in programs that cultivate and develop public speaking and leadership capabilities. They are also being taught skills such as animal husbandry so that they can become economically independent.  Since 2014, more than 160 such workshops have been held, preparing generations of future female leaders. Partners WE Charity partners with many other organizations, school districts, and constituent groups, including the Rick Hansen Foundation, National Youth Leadership Council, World Medical Relief, and Tribes Learning Community."

We're bridging the gap between Big POS and Tablet POS.,"There are 2 classes of POS systems that exist today, and independently owned restaurants are stuck in a gap between them. ""Big POS"" is feature rich and has local support, but is very expensive ($20-25k for a 4 terminal system + thousands in annual support contracts) and not a feasible purchase for the typical independent restaurant owner. ""Tablet POS"" is more affordable, coming in at $3-5k up front, plus a monthly subscription fee, but lacks a lot of features and there is no local support available. Well Done is bridging the gap between Big POS and Tablet POS with a robust cloud-based system that runs on any windows 8 device and is sold and supported locally through a network of value-added resellers (how most Big POS is sold and supported). Our system, which runs $6-10k for a 4 terminal setup, not only comes with local support (unlike Tablet POS), but is robust enough to handle the needs of today's restaurateurs."

WEN® brings a completely different approach to the way you cleanse your hair. Chaz Dean, world-renowned hair expert and Creator of WEN, got his start in developing hair care products at a popular Beverly Hills salon, where he worked as an assistant to the manager. With no prior experience in product development, Chaz was asked to help create a deep conditioner for the salon's own product line.  While some would think he was in over his head, Chaz embraced the challenge and about nine months later, launched a product for his first time. He gained the trust and confidence of the company, and just three months later, he was asked to develop a natural product line. All this ... at the age of just 21.  After more than a year of careful testing using both sides of Chaz's own head, the product line was finally launched. It featured a primrose shampoo, rosemary conditioner and sage conditioner. Word spread fast about the concept of cleansing hair without lather, creating a snowball effect among Hollywood celebrities. Since many of them were actors who had to style their hair for shows, they would come into his salon with damaged hair—all eager to learn how to get shinier, more manageable, healthier-looking hair. It's because of Chaz's relentless drive that WEN® has become a worldwide success. Since WEN® was created 16 years ago, it has sold 40 million bottles and is loved by hundreds of thousands of customers worldwide, from Asia, to Latin America, to the Middle East."

Imagine a startup founder Mike who is good in front-end development, but totally doesn't know how to make effective Facebook CPC campaign. He has already made several ones based on some blog posts and youtube courses. However, in result it appeared that clicks were extremely pricey whereas visitors left the website promptly. Money is spent but result is poor. Using WeMent, Mike found a mentor Duke who is an expert in Facebook ads. Duke has been working with other startups and even some big companies like Puma and KPMG as a digital marketing specialist during last 5 years. Mike, as a part of a group with 5 participants, under the guidance of Duke totally changed his campaign, declined cost of clicks and got first clients.
