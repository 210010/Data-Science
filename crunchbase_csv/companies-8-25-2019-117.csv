WORK180,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/work180,"Recruiting, Staffing Agency", WORK180 is a jobs platform with a difference.,"WORK180 (previously DCC Jobs) is a job site which pre-screens employers against a set of 20 criteria, including pay equity, flexible working, women in leadership and paid parental leave. Only Endorsed Employers for Women are allowed to advertise jobs.After spending 10 years in the tech industry, I had experienced both the “boys’ club” work environments, as well as incredible organisations which valued all employees regardless of gender. Throughout my career, when I applied for a new job, as much as I did my research, I had no idea whether it was with a company which supported women.  Frustrated with the status quo and passionate about helping other women who were experiencing similar challenges, the idea of a job site to solve this problem was born.  The sie would have strict rules around the kind of jobs it listed, with an emphasis on pay equity, flexible working, women in leadership and paid parental leave. Not only would they ask these questions, they would make that information publicly available to women, a first for job boards. I called my good friend and previous work colleague Valeria Ignatieva, pictured on the left, to gather her thoughts on the idea. Being a single parent, and facing her own challenges, Valeria absolutely loved the concept. Together, they created WORK180. At a time when diversity in the workplace was becoming recognised as being both fair AND good for the bottom line, large corporations began contacting us to ask for advice on how they could make improvements to their own business.  Meanwhile, they were helping hundreds of women find the roles they deserved, working for companies that valued their contribution. Then, something even more amazing happened. Businesses who did not meet our criteria at first, began changing their workplaces for the better in order to advertise with WORK180. You can read one of their success stories here. WORK180 is now a recognised Australian success story with a broad range of clients, including industry leaders from technology, banking, mining, construction and retail sectors.  Valeria and I have also become vocal commentators on gender issues and they appear regularly on television, radio and web platforms. In their work, they use an inclusive definition of “woman” and “female” to include all women, especially trans women, genderqueer women, and non-binary people who identify as women in a way that is significant to them.​"

Woodie Milano combines the best of technology with noble materials such as Marble and Wood to create charging devices that are beautiful and extremely useful. “With the release of the new iPhone in Fall 2017, capable of wireless charging straight out of the factory, we’ll witness to the kick-off of a major shift in the world of charging since decades” said Marco Iurilli, Woodie’s CEO and co-founder. “Our goal as Italian design startup is to provide a wireless solution for any occasion where wireless charging is a convenient and efficient alternative to cable charging. We want to be the leader in the high-end segment of wireless charging devices within the next 4 years”. Francesco Dolce, co-founder and designer at Woodie Milano, with the passion and audacity of a 27 years-old young man stated that “we have the dream and the ambition to become for the wireless charging industry what Artemide has become for the light industry or Kartell for the furniture industry: an iconic brand capable of unique and ever lasting shapes and designs”.

Indeed, over the last few years people charging needs have increased together with the effort that hotels have put in to satisfying their guests’ charging requests in the rooms as well as in public areas. Everyone is asking for power, anywhere, at anytime. Marco Iurilli noted that “a general lack of power outlets together with international guests’ requests for travel adapters put pressure on the hotels that frequently struggle to respond promptly and conveniently to the demand. We found out that hotels can spend up to thousands of dollars on purchasing plastic adapters that not only don’t stand up to the services quality of the hotel but not rarely are also taken away by guests thus forcing the hotel to a restock every second month. It's time for hotels to get rid of plastic adapters and bring in some innovative and high-end solutions for their guests. With our products is finally possible and, done the math, also economically convenient.”"

The new app Woofr makes it easy for owners to link up and arrange doggie fun or even date days, love could be in the air for pooches and people alike! While a dog may be a man (or woman's) best friend, this still doesn't change the fact that their nature, as pack animals, is to want to spend time bonding with fellow canines. Did you know that there are over 500 million pet dogs globally, plus 1 in 5 has a social media account?!! Furthermore many people face the problem of not having access to another dog or dogs for their beloved pet to play and bond with, a solution was definitely needed. Answering the call, is what some are calling the “World's First Doggy Dating App” Woofr, a fun mobile app (‘social petwork’ if you will) that allows users to show off their pets to make connections with other local dog owners and arrange doggy play sessions, that will likely help their pets be more happy and healthy, and who knows, love could be on the cards for the owners too! The app is available for free on iOS and is coming soon on Android. So there may be just a bit of doggy romance or at least new friendships in the air for both hounds and humans. “When it comes to making connections swiping left or right has become an integral part of the dating experience for many people,” commented James Gaubert, from Woofr. “Now we've opened the door for pet people to use the same kind of cool and convenient technology to find BFF's for their beloved pooches, and maybe even a little love for themselves, something which everyone is sure to enjoy and appreciate, Woofr is the dating app that puts hounds first and humans second”. https://apple.co/2Kz1t0O"

The Web is the most powerful tool for communication in the history of humanity, creating the potential for all people to participate in building a more peaceful and equitable world. However, only a small minority of people – mainly urban, male, and affluent – are part of the Web’s global conversation. Despite the recent surge in mobile internet access, nearly two-thirds of the world’s people (mostly in the developing world) are still not connected at all. And once connected, what people are able to do on and with the Web is increasingly threatened by government controls, as well as by certain commercial practices. We seek to establish the open Web as a global public good and a basic right, ensuring that everyone can access and use it freely. The foundation is unendowed and relies on charitable donations and partnerships to carry out its work.

Wolfram Bergbau und Hütten,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wolfram-bergbau-und-hutten,Precious Metals,Wolfram Bergbau und Hütten provides tungsten carbide powders for the powder metallurgical industry.,"The company  owes  its origins to  the  discovery   in 1967 of the most substantial  tungsten deposit in Europe in Mittersill (Austria, Salzburg).  Following extensive preparatory work, the original company ""Wolfram Bergbau-und Hüttengesellschaft"" was established in 1975. Tungsten mining and refining is both the mission and program of ""Wolfram Bergbau und Hütten AG"" (abbreviated: WBH).  Through uncompromising specialization on the element tungsten, WBH has emerged as a world-leading manufacturer of tungsten oxide-, tungsten metal-, and tungsten carbide powders.   The unique properties of tungsten makes it indispensible in modern hightech industry. It has the highest melting point of all metals making it suitable for high temperature applications in energy- and lighting technology, and in the space industry. With a density comparable to gold (Au), it is used in flywheel and counter-balance weights and anti-vibration toolholders in aerospace, automotive, sport, and telecommunications applications. Tungsten serves as a substitute for lead (Pb) and is used as radiation-shielding in medical engineering. When combined with carbon as tungsten carbide it exhibits diamond-like hardness and, thereby, forms the basis of modern cutting and drilling tools in metal-, stone-, plastics-, and wood-working.  Applications range from hair-like miniature drills for the electronics industry and drills used in mining and tunnelling to specialized tools for cutting, pressing, and forming. Often working unnoticed, tungsten is present throughout our modern world and provides the basis for achieving the highest performance and efficiency in many key industries. Due to its high melting point, tungsten is not smelted and fabricated like many other metals, but is pressed as a fine powder and consolidated by sintering. WBH specializes in the production of highly pure and extremely fine-grained tungsten oxide, tungsten metal and tungsten carbide powders for the powder metallurgical (PM) industry.   Own mining activities in Mittersill and a wide scope of recycling capabilities in St. Martin guarantee independent and secured raw materials supply valued by leading enterprises world-wide.   Permanent  research and development activities and state-of-the-art production facilities (most of which are based upon own 'know-how') ensure extraordinary high quality levels, and create the potential for future developments."
