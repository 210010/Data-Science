Monoclonal antibodies usually take several months to generate. Our custom service can be focussed on a particular application so that the resultant aptamers are pre-optimized for use with a given detection platform, sample type and assay buffer.  Aptamers themselves are increasingly being perceived as the state of the art reagent of choice for a wide range of applications including: Imaging experiments: fluorescence, bright field and phase contrast, IHC, ICC Quantification: ELISA (or ELONA), homogeneous assays etc. Rapid diagnostics: Lateral flow devices, biosensors, electrochemical detection, nano-wires  Binding studies: label free detection, SPR, Biolayer Interferometry Purification: affinity chromatography  We also offer an aptamer based assay development service.  Our solution can be used to identify aptamers for virtually any application and against almost any target in almost any condition.

ApplyMap was founded by two UCLA graduate students, Dan Lim and Steve Palley, in the summer of 2013. As teaching assistants in the Department of Political Science, they spent a lot of time teaching UCLA undergraduates. After a while they noticed a pattern: their students were all smart and hard working, but the very best of the best -- the ones who really stood out from the crowd -- were often from less affluent backgrounds. These students had the academic talent and drive to get into a great school like UCLA, but they were also lucky, because college admissions isn’t a level playing field. The competition is fierce, and naturally, applicants use every tool at their disposal to succeed. For every one of the lucky ones who made it into a school like UCLA, how many other great students had missed out on getting into the best possible school for them, simply because they couldn’t afford to hire expert help to guide them through the process? We built ApplyMap to answer this question. We want to fill the growing need for high quality college advice in an intelligent, intuitive and affordable way. Our job is to help as many students as we can understand the possibilities and risks when applying to college.

On a basic level, we develop custom social networking sites. On a more important level, we introduce communities to each other. Clients can choose their own level of integration: private networks operate internally and are ideal for organizations sharing sensitive or proprietary information; open networks are categorized and integrated by topic, allowing clients to reach out to a broader audience, generate more traffic and register new users. Who can benefit from a social network? Companies Governments Brands NGOs Schools Interest groups Churches Unions Musicians Developers Artists Entrepreneurs Sports franchises Housing management Your neighbour Or anyone building of the 600,000 sites that goes online everyday Examples:  Multinational corp, communicate more efficiently, top-down, bottom-up, Bangkok to Chicago. Sports clubs can interact with fans, sell tickets, provide a place for discussion, (top level, down) What problem do we solve? AppLaunch gives clients direct access to their own communities without relying on other platforms (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) or consenting to third-party Terms and Conditions. Clients ""own"" their members and use the power of social networking to manage their brand and maximize profits. The integration makes it easier to start a community from nothing. If you already have a user base, AppLaunch makes it easier to manage the community and tighten the community. How are we disruptive? Just as WordPress and Blogspot have led the publishing revolution, AppLaunch revolutionizes social networking by putting the power of social media back into the hands of brands, enterprises, organizations, entrepreneursâ€”anyone seeking to control their online social presence. The untapped applications of social technology extend far beyond socializing. Why would clients want their own social network? Brand control Brand loyalty Employee productivity Information flow Customer knowledge and interaction Extreme analytics Informed decision making Smarter allocation of resources Discovery of new business opportunities Independence from third party sites Maximized profits Facebook knows a lot about their customers, now everyone can."
