JolPi is committed to create life changing products that will provide innovative solutions to critical problems. “We put meaning into things and that give people a reason to own our product and feel proud of it”, this is how Reza Ul Kabir the founder and CEO of JolPi summarized the company. Problem Statement ------------------------------- Based on a report from Titas the number of accident caused by gas leakage is more than 5000 a year. That means in every two hours one accident is taking place at homes across major cities of Bangladesh.  The country has seen a very low progress in the development of electronics industry. This can be attributed to our reluctance in venturing into electronics industry to produce advanced and original products locally.  Solution ------------- We have rolled out our very own gas leakage detector called “Sniffer” in three different variations which can avert potentially fatal accidents by detecting gas leakage within the quickest possible time.  To address our people’s lack of passion to pursue electrical engineering in Bangladesh, we are assiduously working to build a completely local electronics company that will instill the belief in others that we possess the capacity to produce advanced and original electronic hardware in Bangladesh. We have a billion dollar hardware market in the country, and our aim is to make low cost products with impeccable quality that will help us be a profitable venture. Company Overview ------------------------------- JolPi was founded in 2015 by Reza Ul Kabir as a part time electronic R&D and eventually became a full time dedicated business from August 2016. After getting huge attention with its initial R&D activities JolPi finally incorporated as ‘JolPi Electronics Ltd’ in 2017. In the initial 2 years JolPi spent all its effort building its capacity and search for a right product market fit and decided to work on IoT based Smart Home Safety Security and Healthcare Device. JolPi started with a R&D heavy product called ‘xS1’ an IoT based access and appliance control device. Although the sophisticated technology of ‘xS1’ quickly drew the attention of  local and international technology fascinated audience, it turned out to be an investment hungry product for the early stage of the company. After more than six months of hard work JolPi decided to postpone its release date and reschedule for one of its MVP called Sniffer, a gas leakage alarm for kitchen. This major decision brought  great opportunities for the company to achieve huge success. The product was released very quickly and sold out at its pre-order campaign within the first few weeks.   Achievement/Traction/Milestones ------------------------------------------------------- After releasing the first product of JolPi in Jan 2017, the company has received enormous response from the market and the tech community  which has enabled it to reach great heights in a short period of time. Oct 2017: JolPi has received partnership offer from Amazon for its AWS IoT platform and other services.  Oct  2017: JolPi has signed up a partnership with Grameenphone Ltd to co-brand and market its SIM based IoT products together.

Johari Shop wants to provide customers with the largest selection of precious jewellery at a marketplace of numerous manufacturers in India with in store previews and 'touch n feel' experience before purchase at our strategically chosen partner stores. Gap: 1. In India with such high regional preferences in designs, selection is the biggest problem in offline jewellery buying. Offline channel can't solve it due to physical and monetary limitations, current online players solve it to a level but it is woefully inadequate as vertical destinations (BlueStone, CaratLane) have their own designs and manufacturing so selection is curtailed there. Horizontal players ( Flipkart, Snapdeal) can't provide a good jewellery buying experience which is very much evident by the fact that the vertical players sell 12 times more than the horizontal players.  2. Even though the pricing and selection in onine jewellery is relatively better but still the online shoppers  tend to have a cold feet when making the actual purchase. How can people spend thousands of dollars on such an intimate shopping experience without even handling the merchandise. 'Touch n feel' is one of the most important parameter after selection.

The family business, started by their grandfather in 1936, originally produced everything from vehicle wing mirrors to fridge shelves. But eventually it diversified into making decorative glass chopping boards, illustrated with rustic scenes. When tastes changed and demand began to wane it was clear a fresh approach was needed. Having both trained in product design, the brothers were now embarking on their early careers – Antony as a freelance product designer and Richard studying for a master’s degree in design and manufacturing at Cambridge. When their father asked them to look at reinventing the glass chopping board range, they jumped at the chance. After early success with their creative, colourful designs, their entrepreneurial spirit kicked in and in 2003 they decided to go it alone – and with that the Joseph Joseph brand was born. Their big leap forward though came from a simple observation – many everyday objects can actually create problems for the user through poor design. In addition, many tasks around the home could be made much easier and more enjoyable with a little intelligent thinking. From this light-bulb moment Antony and Richard knew they’d found a way to differentiate Joseph Joseph from other brands. And it set them on a path that was to create some truly iconic kitchenware. There’s something special about a Joseph Joseph product that sets it apart from the competition. First it engages you with its innovative design. Then it captivates you with its functional benefits. Finally, it assures you with its high quality materials and attention to detail. Joseph Joseph’s ability to blend innovative design, contemporary styling and a distinctive use of colour is unique within the industry. While many brands concentrate on just one of these aspects, Joseph Joseph focuses on the whole user experience – creating products that work beautifully and are a pleasure to have around the home. Since 2003 the brand has expanded successfully into many product areas and it continues to explore new housewares categories. It may have all started with a simple glass chopping board but Joseph Joseph is now one of the fastest growing companies in the worldwide housewares market and it continues to earn accolades and awards for its unique, innovative designs."

JOIN Technologies,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/join-vr,"Augmented Reality, Content, Messaging, Mobile, Video, Virtual Reality",Making 360 media interactive by adding an augmented live layer of user-generated communication,"We call our technology “augmented 360 worlds”. These are worlds that people can join through a mobile app or web interface to communicate with each other about what every one discovers and experiences in that world. It has the potential to teleport and unite people across the globe. We set out to revolutionize the way in which people experience spherical online media. The problem with existing VR and AR approaches is that they offer either mainly creation of 360 content or mainly playback of videos. What’s missing is: (1) a cheap device <$50 to create quality content on the smartphone at the push of a button, (2) a fifth dimension of communication on top of 360 content. But in the world of 360 media, if you really want to create something revolutionary, you need to combine an offering that goes from creation to sharing to communicating - all in the same app. This would eventually require bundling the application with an affordable creation device that’s extremely fast and easy to use - a 360 camera for the masses. That’s precisely what we managed to add to our application. But instead of inventing our own Insta360 or an own Ricoh Theta, we did something much smarter. We invented a tool that is a camera, yet it doesn’t need any power as it doesn’t have any electronics. What we have created is an accessory for smartphones that captures photos and videos simultaneously from both the front and main camera to combine them into a real 360 photo or video. This will sell for a low as $50 and will open up the world of 360 media creation to all smartphone users. Of course, it doesn’t stop there. With the JOIN application, people can not just create real 360 content, they can also share it and communicate inside of it in a totally efficient and fun way.  It’s sort of a Google Earth for user-generated 360 content. Content will be created by millions of smartphone users, who use the same app to create, share and invite millions of other users to join augmented 360 worlds they created. JOIN is something that everyone should have available tomorrow on their mobile phones. In addition we developed a unique ""no-electronics"" accessory that allows smartphone users to create 360 videos and photos on their own devices in the most efficient and fun way at the lowest cost possible."

Jobhop,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/job-hop,"Employment, Recruiting",Because A Job Isn't For Life Connect with great people and great employers,"Businesses are struggling to recruit digital talent Jobhop helps by connecting great candidates to great employers in a social way! We're on a mission at Jobhop.co.uk to make the recruitment / employment experience better! We believe the recruitment / employment experience could be a lot better We believe that by connecting candidate to employer, employer to candidate will make employment human We believe that engaging communities come before the job vacancy….Once an employer creates communities, they can build relationships with potential candidates and it removes the panic to job push and hire the wrong person. We believe that a great company culture has a lot to do with attracting great candidates There's a MASSIVE PROBLEM!  Businesses are really struggling to recruit digital talent It's predicted that by 2017 there will be 1.1m digital jobs across the UK which will require filling.  There's a HUGE GAP!  For businesses to evolve they need young digital talent  Employers and Recruiters are struggling with where to find them though, they think Linkedin might be the answer but they're wrong, Linkedin isn't social enough for young digital talent. The average age on Linkedin is 45 and according to Pew many Linkedin connections are retired from business altogether. Our young digital talent who know of Linkedin ( many don't) think it's just stuffy business networking which doesn't appeal to them at all. Young digital talent are being social on other social media platforms, many of these platforms employers haven't heard of or don't understand.  There's a SOLUTION We've already created the solution it's Jobhop.co.uk  A social site with employment in mind, it's not a job board!  Jobhop connects people, we know that good relationships = loyalty and sustainability, the job comes later. Jobhop enables people to showcase themselves, we understand that everyone is on the market of opportunities even when they're not actively looking. Jobhop enables people to follow other peoples job journeys because it may help them to plot their own job journey. Jobhop enables people to get close to employers and find out more about their businesses, who they employ and what their culture is like. We conducted research into what young digital candidates were looking for and 68% said they would choose company culture above money. With that in mind we educate businesses on what a good company culture means and how that can attract great talent. Giving employers using Jobhop the ability to build engaging communities of possible recruits is beneficial not only to them but also to the candidates who are eager to learn more about the organisation.  The Jobhop mission is to make employment human and we believe that our platform will help to make that happen. We aim to tackle issues like job adverts, outdated CVs, the terrible recruitment process, bad interviews, candidates not hearing back after interviews, rigid job descriptions etc...    Why the name Jobhop? “Because a job isn’t for life” You’ll notice that this is our strap-line. It used to be that people would leave education and go and get a “job for life”, not anymore, that type of job security isn’t about anymore and even if it was who would want a job for life? An average life-span of a job is now 3 years and that’s because our young generation of workers want as much experience as they can get, they want to climb the career ladder fast and they wont hang about in a job that they’re dissatisfied with, they’ll simply hop to another. This means our young generation of employees could easily have up to 20 jobs during their working life. Understanding why someone would want to job hop then gives the employer an advantage, knowledge is power. Our young generation are driven more by culture, ethics and the mission of the company they work for. Understanding what drives them the employer would be wise to hire for culture match first, making sure that the ethics also match, as well as being very clear about the company mission. Knowing that young employees want to climb the career ladder fast employers must show them a route within the organisation where they can achieve that. When employers understand that young employees have a thirst for experience then they should make sure that there are plenty of opportunities for them to learn different skills and develop. On top of that the employer needs to understand that our young generation have a different way of working, they like flexibility, they like to collaborate, they work fast and they’re hyper-connected. Talking about hyper-connectivity, the young generation of workers will expect good technology, you better make sure they get it! Now armed with that knowledge an employer can encourage job-hopping within the company, if everything ticks the right boxes and there’s opportunity to grow and further their career within the company then why look anywhere else? Sometimes there will be great employees who just have to spread their wings and get further experience elsewhere to build up their connections and networks, when that happens it’s good to let them go but leave the door open for when they want to come back home. Speaking to some companies who have got this completely right say when their employees come back home, they’re then home for good! Job hopping is now seen in a positive light. Jobhoppers themselves are well connected, skilled, experienced, ambitious and energised, they crave to learn more and continuously want to develop, sounds like the ideal employee to me. What job hopping also means is that now companies need to step up, to keep hold of good employees they need to do a lot more, no longer is it enough to just provide someone with a job, our young generation want everything that having a job means, which goes back to culture, ethics, mission, vision and values. If a company lacks on any of them then they’ll definitely lack on talent as employees will be job hopping off to the competitor! At Jobhop we want to show employers how to really tap into great people by understanding them, being human about employment, being transparent and eventually learning how to attract good candidates naturally. We also want to help people to do the jobs they love, everyone should do what they love! It makes sense to, we would be a much more productive country if that happened. Talking about country, we’re on a mission to keep our talent in the U.K, we have to! There’s lots more to Jobhop but you’ll find out all about it if you join the journey with us, I hope you do. Why the space-hopper? Why not? Space hoppers are fun! At Jobhop we think everybody should love what they do and have lots of fun! They're also the colour orange which is zesty, fun and energetic, perfect for Jobhop and the people who use it!"

Johnson Industries,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/johnson-industries,"Automotive, Logistics, Manufacturing, Mining",Johnson Industries is still growing and expanding into new areas.

What better credentials would a manufacturer of mining equipment need? In other words, they have ""been there and done that."" They understand the inner workings of mining equipment first hand because they have ""hands on"" experience that some manufacturers may lack. That speaks well for  the quality of equipment Johnson Industries manufactures and explains the unsullied reputation they have earned over the years. Johnson Brothers Coal Company was established in 1974 by five Johnson brothers - Greg, Garla, Gwendel, Garnie, and George, all coming from different walks of life, but all with an innate ability to think and create. Their ability to design innovative solutions to the challenges they faced on the job paid off. The Kinney Branch Company that Garnie supervised became the highest ton per man hour coal producer in the United States. A  back injury shortened George's coal mining life, but maybe it was a ""blessing in disguise,"" because after that he devoted his time to design and production. In 1981, they established Johnson Industries and immediately started manufacturing the industrial duty car, followed by the Super Low Tail Piece. A patented laser alignment tool for the underground mining industry (Slimm-Jim Laser) was developed next and it quickly gained industry acceptance. Johnson Industries' next proud accomplishment was the Stinger - an MSHA permissible and explosion proof personnel carrier that became a top seller in the industry. One rugged product after another has emerged from Johnson Industries, with each piece proving increased efficiency and improved safety."
