Once the veins lose their ability to convey blood without reflux, the progressive venous disease cycle has begun. This is commonly referred to as chronic venous insufficiency, or CVI. The blood will begin to back up into the peripheral veins, causing venous hypertension, potential thrombosis (clotting), and leading to even more damage of the vein walls and valves. This in turn leads to more reflux. The VENITI team of experts in science, technology and business are currently developing the VENITI VICI VENOUS STENT® System.

Categorized as surface cancer on the inside lining of the bladder, NMIBC affects 2 million people globally with 300,000 new cases reported every year. TransUrethral Resection of Bladder Tumor (TURBT) is the leading first-line therapy. Yet, this invasive surgical procedure, requiring a costly hospital stay performed under general anesthesia, can often be inadequate.   In up to 80% of cases the cancer returns, with increased complications as patients need multiple repeat procedures that further reduce quality of life. Vessi's minimally invasive NMIBC solution provides a new, first-line, office-based therapy alternative to surgery. The company's patent-pending, bladder-specific cryotherapy technology eliminates costly and problematic repeat surgeries seen with TURBT, reducing the need for hospital stay by providing in office or ambulatory treatment. The technology successfully ablates unwanted tissue, reduces the risk of dispersed cancers cells, all while causing no bladder damage. The Vessi system consists of a standalone console and a disposable catheter that is inserted into the bladder.  Vessi is backed by the Trendlines Group, a leading Israeli early stage investor, and led by seasoned medical device and cryotherapy veterans.  The company has already demonstrated promising proof of concept in animals with its Alpha product.  Vessi’s first application will initially target the $1.2 billion NMIBC market, with future applications for the treatment of overactive bladder and urinary tract infections, both billion-dollar markets."

Venture Giant,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/venture-giant,"Finance, FinTech",Entrepreneurs connect with Investors,"The two problems facing entrepreneurs in the UK seeking to raise investment funding for their business Venture or Startups currently are: 1) Entrepreneurs are only really allowed to send their business plan and investment pitch to investors that have ""self-certified themselves as high net worth individuals or sophisticated investors"". Current strict regulations prevent entrepreneurs and small business owners on sending their business plan or investment pitch to “Regular Joe Public”.  2) The other problem facing entrepreneurs seeking to raise investment for their business venture are on how to locate and pitch to these elusive investors in the UK without revealing too much information on the business idea especially when valuable IP (intellectual property) is involved. Venture Giant is an online Angel Investor platform that was created to solve these exact problems and bridge the gap between both Worlds. Not only does Venture Giant solve the immediate problem on how to locate these self-certified high net worth individuals and angel investors but also solves the problem on how to present an investment proposal to them without revealing too much sensitive information on the business idea itself. All entrepreneurs and small businesses that are seeking to raise investment from private investors for their business ventures are able to use the investment platform, and private investors can browse these proposals in a friendly - easy to use environment. The difference between a Crowd Funding Site and an online Angel Investment platform like Venture Giant is that investment ranges of £20,000 to £500,000 can be raised from through a syndicate of 1 - 5 individual investors as opposed to raising funds through hundreds of single individuals through Crowd funding websites. Some businesses do benefit from funding from the crowd, whereas other entrepreneurs choose to not reveal their valuable IP in such a public format as a crowd funding site. Investment proposals featured by Venture Giant can only be viewed by high net worth individuals and sophisticated investors that have signed self-certification agreements, and are eligible to legally browse these investment deals posted from entrepreneurs for all funding amounts and regions in the UK. Notably, Venture Giant does not feature full business plans, but opts to feature one pager, taster investment summaries to find investor interest. Venture Giant also sends out these deals to investors as filtered deal flow and takes a more active approach in promoting each investment proposal. The total combined pool of Angel investment available from UK Investors on the platform currently stand at over£3bn and grows daily as more investors self-certify themselves to use the online investment platform. Venture Giant has recently been nominated ""Best investment network award"" by Angel Investor News and has been reviewed extensively in the Press including articles featured in the Sunday Telegraph, and have raised over £2.2m for start-ups and property deals, commission free. They are currently not FCA regulated which means that they are not a commission collecting service. This works best when an entrepreneur needs the freedom of negotiating the best terms on what works best for their business.

The first products were fabricated fiberglass components for the 2.75 Rocket sold to the United States government. Imaginative R&D led to the creation of a proprietary fiberglass filter coalescer in 1957. This revolutionary product was initially introduced to both military and commercial aviation fuel markets and subsequently to pipelines and refineries. Velcon now supplies more replacement cartridges to purify jet fuel than any other company in the world. In 1979, Velcon introduced to the market its patented Aquacon® water-absorbing cartridges which remove water and dirt from industrial oils and fuels, restoring the oil or fuel to a clean, usable condition. The outer layers of filter media remove particulate contaminants, while the inner layers chemicallyretain water within the super-absorbent media. As the cartridge reaches its absorption capacity, the media expands rapidly to restrict the flow of unfiltered oil or fuel, signaling the operator to replace the cartridge. In 1991, Lu Taylor became Chairman of the Board and his son David C. Taylor assumed the position of President. Dave Taylor brought with him a broad range of technical and management experience. Velcon’s commitment to quality has been recognized through its achievement of the ISO 9001 Certification of Registration in 2000. Most recently Velcon has requalified for ISO 9001, proving its continuing achievement of quality standards. Velcon is also the first filter manufacturer to receive qualifications for all three categories of the EI 1581 5th Edition Specification. In April 2009, Velcon Filters, LLC was acquired by Sterling Group, LP, a private equity investment firm that targets controlling interests in basic manufacturing, industrial services and distribution companies. The Taylor family and members of management continue in their roles as substantial shareholders in Velcon in partnership with Sterling. “The Velcon team believes this partnership will provide significant opportunities to further develop and expand the company’s reach,” said David Taylor, who remains CEO of Velcon. In November, 2009, Velcon acquired Chemflo, a process filtration company, creating “Velcon Process,” a division of Velcon Filters, LLC. Chemflo was founded in 1998. Velcon Process works as partners with petrochemical producers, refineries, transmission companies, gas plants, food and beverage producers and other process industries to improve their overall process as it relates to filtration and separation. In 2010, in an ongoing effort to ensure quality products, Velcon constructed a diesel fuel test lab at its Colorado facility. Now Velcon is poised to verify the effectiveness of its filtration products for the rapidly expanding diesel and biodiesel market."
