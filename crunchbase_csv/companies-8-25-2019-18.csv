Capitalizing on the confluence of advances in AI and high-performance cloud computing – along with the rapid increase of sensors capturing information all over the globe – Descartes Labs has created an enterprise data refinery that enables organizations to model – and predict changes in – natural resources and the entire value chains in which they live. With an initial focus on satellite imagery, Descartes Labs processes a pipeline of data flows from all the major satellite constellations, at scale, to provide instant access to analysis-ready images of the entire world via a massive, searchable, on-demand interface. For example, petabytes of imagery can be searched and retrieved, and all features from various constellations accessed, in under 100 milliseconds.  By collecting, normalizing, and presenting science-ready data generated by satellites, the Descartes Labs Platform is advancing and accelerating unique applications of machine intelligence for consumers, corporations, and governments worldwide.

About Us Great companies start with an idea and an inspiration. Our idea was to make the car buying process better, faster and simpler. And our inspiration was technology. In 1997 that spark led Mark Bonfigli, Rick Gibbs, Mike Lane, Jamie LaScolea and Ryan Dunn to found Dealer.com and begin redefining the expectations of the auto industry. By bringing a full suite of digital marketing tools to OEMs and dealers, coupled with direct consultation to make those tools work harder for customers, we helped to change the digital face of the industry. But we didn’t just focus on the world outside – we looked inward, to see how we could create a work environment that was unlike any other – where the desire to be creative, innovative, healthy, expressive and fun were nurtured and appreciated at a whole new level. It was the collective fostering of these missions that made Dealer.com what it is today: an 850-person strong company with bi-coastal offices serving 40 percent of the auto industry’s marketing needs; all made possible through a culture rich in openness, wellness, development, community engagement, and individuality."

Dented Brick Distillery,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dented-brick-distillery,"Advertising, Distillery, Marketing, Retail, Wine And Spirits",Medium Sized Craft Distillery," Company Stage:	$0-$500K trailing annual rev.  Est. Pre-Money Valuation:	$5,000,000 Previous capital raised:  $2,100,000 Amount of capital seeking:  $1,500,000 Monthly burn rate:	$50,000	Current year revenue:	$200,000 Number of employees:	5 - 10	Date company was founded:	March 2012 Dented Brick Distillery is an award winning, fully operational, and high capacity distilled spirits plant producing old world craft spirits. Dented Brick has utilized web based sales programming and big data analytics to achieve strategic wholesale partnerships and distribution in 11 states offering 7 products. Our go to market strategy is based on the concept of brand activation at the on-premise point of sale. We have developed a web based portal to deliver utilitarian brand items to accounts. Our sales team is offered monthly sales programs to incentivise them to sell our brand, and the portal allows the sales member to deliver branded items to an account during a sales call as an incentive to the account to purchase our items. On-premise brand activation lead to off-premise sales. Federal law requires suppliers of alcohol contract distributors to sell their product to retailers. This is an impediment to customers wanting Craft brands. Due to mass consolidation of distribution, craft suppliers have few options of distributors to choose from. Small brands with distribution use sale forces that sell the equivalent mega brand. Small brands do not have the budget to activate consumers in the traditional mega brand campaign. The market share of U.S. Craft spirits reached 3.0% in value in 2015, up from 1.1% in 2010. This places 97% of the market in the hands of very large corporations like Beam Suntory. These mega brand competitors utilize massive budgets and national agency advertising and events. In addition, craft suppliers have few options of distributors to choose from. Our proprietary web portal and on-premise brand activation strategy allows us to end run this barrier, and go direct to the millennial consumer. Distributors are receptive to marketing offered by all suppliers. DBD is developing a web based platform to assist distributors with brand activation at on-premise locations through direct delivery of point of sale branding merchandise, a low-cost method to compete with the more expensive traditional branding campaigns used by mega brands. This method will offer a sales channel to the craft buyer and eventual crossover to off premise sales. Utilizing our proprietary data compilation tool, DBD can identify trends in the market on a monthly basis. We will be able to target trends at a state by state or national level in categories and brands to steer our product development and marketing. Our proprietary DentedBrick.com web portal allows distribution sales personnel to design custom point of sale merchandise on-line on-site, directly activating consumers at the point of sale. DBD is a national wholesale distribution company, and has contracted with Aurora Wine and Spirits, a national wholesaler with contacts and knowledge needed to assist DBD gain distribution in all targeted markets. The DBD on-premise support program will drive customer retention. The company value will increase exponentially with repeat customers in a multi-state distribution environment. The U.S. distilled spirits market in 2017 equated to $78.07 bn in sales, with the largest sub-category of spirits is vodka at 34%, then whiskey at 24%, and rum at 12%. The spirits industry has experienced steady growth over the last ten years. The spirits segment volume has been growing at a CAGR of 2% over the last 10 years. Smaller brands have been gaining share. The non-top 5 brands gained between 12 and 37 % over a 20 year period and between 2 and 9% in the last 5 years. Craft products like Tito’s Vodka and Hendrick’s Gin have become attractive brands. Millennials are driving the shift to Craft, using their purchasing power to disrupt the market. Surveys show Millennials drink more different types of spirits (vodka, rum, tequila and whiskey) than other generations. Often, as is the case with gin, new infusions that may have been impossible to market in the past are quickly becoming millennial mainstays. Marc Christensen, Founder, is a regulated markets wholesale distribution specialist and a proven entrepreneur as illustrated with the ongoing success of OTW Safety and US Wine. Mike McSorley, Head Distiller, has more than 20 years industry experience and has been a distiller with 2 prior operations. Karina Soriano has had industry experience as the Marketing lead for National Chain Even Steven Sandwiches. Channalyn Tek was formally the front of the house manager at the Grand America Hotel.

It will allow food delivery businesses to borrow and lend drivers from one another at short notice. In addition, GPS tracking will provide full visibility of all orders.  One member generates revenue from otherwise redundant resource while the other is able to keep their customer satisfied. Food delivery businesses can't always predict when there will be a surge in the number of orders received and as such struggle to meet customer expectations with timely deliveries. One of the key contributors to this is the limited access to delivery drivers. Further, the majority don't have access to an affordable solution to track their drivers which then makes the dispatch process inefficient. The Delivery Club technology platform is being designed to tackle both of these challenges, providing a holistic solution. With the comfort that they can access drivers when needed, we believe these businesses would be more inclined to increase their marketing spend and grow their businesses. Further, they would have the ability to earn money towards the cost of their delivery drivers when they would otherwise be idle. The GPS tracking would allow them to run a more efficient dispatch process and increase customer satisfaction levels.

The human capacity to create theories or hunches can have profound impact on the direction and effectiveness of organisations, enterprise and countries. Decision Point utilises an Augmented Intelligence Platform built on subjective logic to refine and explicitly emphasise the factors and certainties that underwrite decision options. Additionally the Decision Point Augmented Intelligence Platform utilises human insights as part of its data queries to augment the processing power of the AI with context and meaning of that data through human knowledge and expertise. Subjective logic is a type of probabilistic logic that combines the capacity of probability theory to handle uncertainty with the capacity of deductive logic to exploit structure of formal argument. Subjective logic explicitly takes uncertainty and source data trust into account. Subjective logic is suitable for modelling and analysing situations involving uncertainty and relatively unreliable sources. Subjective logic can be used for modelling and analysing trust networks where a measurement of the degree to which one social actor (an individual or a group) trusts another social actor and Bayesian networks that represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Bayesian networks are ideal for taking an event that occurred and predicting the likelihood that any one of several possible known causes was the contributing factor. For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms."
