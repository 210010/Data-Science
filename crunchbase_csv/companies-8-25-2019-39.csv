Hiyacar,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hiyacar,"Automotive, Leisure, Ride Sharing, Tourism, Travel",Hiyacar is a UK peer to peer car sharing platform.,"Car fiend Graeme worked long hours in the City and knew his car cost him money just to sit on his drive, doing nothing. Not so much an asset, more of a liability. With the help of e-commerce expert Rob, the pair realised that a car-sharing app (an ‘AirBnB for cars’) might offer a smarter, more environmentally friendly way for people in Britain to hire the 10 million cars rented here every year. The pair began work in August 2014, and it soon became clear that the obstacle to unlocking the value in people’s cars was simple: the keys, and the time it took to hand them over. The team worked on an app-controlled box which allowed users to unlock cars direct from the app. The QuickStart® box was born. Rob and Graeme hired their first employee in 2016, and have watched hiyacar evolve into a friendly, living community, and a company of 16 people. hiyacar still puts people first - and unlike others they were born and bred in Britain. Each hiyacar shared could take the equivalent of 11 vehicles off the road. People are getting to know their neighbours, too.

HITbills,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/moneysaveapp,"Billing, Customer Service, FinTech, Software",HITbills will save you more money than Uber or Airbnb: patent-pending money saving app for 500 million households,"HITbills will save you more money than Uber or Airbnb Today @ TechCrunch London 20 Oct 2014 is the first public demo of HitBills Hitbills is not a typical startup – it focuses on boring topics, such as commodity prices. It is not entertainment or communication; it simply saves the money everyone pays monthly. Hitbills found an easy way to reduce costs – just scan your bills with smartphone, or simply tap “Yes”, geolocalization and automatic data gathering algorithm will find you better deals.  HITbills conducts auction for commodity suppliers in your area  (electricity, gas, phone, Internet,  TV, bank services and loans refinancing) with one-tap switch if you decide. Why money can be saved ? The secret of business is that due to global deregulation, there are plenty of cheaper providers (or cheaper banks), offering exactly the same product with lower margin. We talk about really big money (according to Forbes’s list of Top 1000 companies by revenue, commodity sector is  the top – because everybody pays bills – Google ranks at #63, Facebook at #101). Average savings per household are 10-40% (depending on localization) – multiply it by 12, and imagine that you got 1000$ for extra holidays – it is what HITbills does.  And there are 500+ millions households qualifying for reducing bills. Why money can be earned ? Moreover, HITbills gets commission for every switch – the money companies usually pay to their agents or for media advertising – and passes it to smartphone owner (holding %). So customer has double benefit – cheaper utilites + cashback.  And, if you want to get some extra money, you can scan bills of your friends, neighbors, family– everyone saves, you earn. Millions of people use the homebills price comparison websites, but the process is too complicated for 60% of households.  HITbills makes it simple - just scan bills with smartphone. How does it works ? Technically:  the scanned bill goes through OCR , where anonymous usage data are being extracted:  then supplier bid for the bill in real-time reverse auction: finally, the user gets savings . It consists of smartphone app + OCR system + comparison engine + affiliate network. All elements are popular, so this invention can be quickly launched to any market. Where it works ? Hitbills started in Poland; it looks for VC, price comparers, entrepreneurs and partners worldwide, especially in Europe and USA, where the deregulation of energy market is forced by law. The technology and business method is patented in Europe and USA.  HITbills offers master license per country, promotion and shares for local-market partners."

Now you will be confused you will go to any event management company and they will charge you unexpected and they will give you quotation which you can’t understand now here you are paying more because they are getting equipment and assets from other vendor and will add their commission in that around 30% and you will pay that much amount along with GST. We are an start-up company with a expert team from event industry making event industry simple because sometimes people don't know how they can get event equipment, venue, artist, sometimes they get the things but unable to execute because they don't have much time as they need to work for their own event. If you are one who is getting married or your brother/sister getting married you can’t organize your event by yourself. If you hire an event company then they will charge you high because you don’t know what actual charges are. Basically our target is corporate houses for their events like conferences, meetings annual day, sports day etc. You can choose venue online, select, equipment, artist, and budget also. At hire4event we have gained experience from big events like IPL, AUTOEXPO, SUNBURN,NH7,F1. etc. currently our revenue is two Cr. per year but will go high this year as we are getting leads from top event companies and corporate .Plus point with us is we do have in-house production and equipment so currently we serving direct client and to event management companies also.Hire4event.com have event consultant to whom you can consult regarding venues, process, management, ticketing, budgeting, promotion and marketing etc and you can plan accordingly. We suggest go to hire4event.com portal select event type, select location, select number of people, select budget and send us rest leave on us.  In the growing Event Industry and Event Management Services the competition is tough to provide the best at the lowest cost possible. This has affected the morale of youth who are seeking for a career in the Event Business. Many freelancers turn into Event Entrepreneurs to seek growth in the Event Management Industry because their is a very little success in the Industry in this business as an employee. Even the success in becoming an Event Entrepreneur is not sure. One has to struggle and compete among the existing Event Management Companies in the area. There a lot of different concepts and ideas in every Event Entrepreneur to proceed and attract potential clients and customers but due to the lack of patience they are left behind in the chase. Every business needs a concrete & unique idea and concept and an positive approach towards the work. What most of the Event Management Companies seek is instant project with phenomenal profit and in that approach they usually discard the small projects in place. Some businesses do succeed but most of the businesses lag behind. The most important thing what Event Entrepreneurs do not think about is brand promotion. Event Companies do brand promotion like stuff for their clients so that their client could achieve a visibility in the market and gain projects, customers or clients. But the important thing is to notice that the Event Management companies also needs their Brand Name to be promoted. They must do the Brand Promotion for themselves also. Then only they will get the recognition they are seeking for the market. See the industry is vast and so Every Entrepreneur or business must maintain or posses a USP. Yes USP, because how your targeted audience will choose you if you don’t contain any reason to be chosen off. There must be some specialization in your work. Either you are specialized in Wedding Events, Corporate Events, Birthday Parties, Corporate Parties, Event Production, Music Concerts, Exhibition Planning etc. Whatever you do from the list, you have to be astonishing and remarkable because more than the marketing, word of mouth works more for any Event Management Company."

Hire Jungle,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hire-jungle,"Marketplace, Peer to Peer, Rental",UK's #1 P2P renting marketplace.,"London-based HireJungle.co.uk announces the launch out-of-beta of its peer-to-peer renting platform, enabling users to hire out goods and services at no cost. Founded by MBA Marcelo Barreneche, the new eBay-like hire-and-rent platform comes at a time when consumers in the UK are struggling with the nation’s economy. Nonetheless the founder says that the sharing economy “is a more efficient trading model, sustainable either in times of crisis or prosperity”. HireJungle is Barreneche’s answer to the fast-growing and disruptive sharing economy. He believes it was already a fairly developed market but users simply didn’t have the right tools. The serial entrepreneur is confident that if users have widely accessible, reliable platforms, then people would turn to sharing stuff in any circumstances, either to save or the other way round - to earn extra income. “The first ‘Eureka!’ moment,” says Barreneche, “was when I needed a drill for a home refurbishing task and I didn’t have one, but I wasn’t happy with the option of buying a new one only to use it just once a year.” “Then I thought it might be a good idea to hire one drill… But where? From whom? And that started the brainstorming that led to this peer-to-peer platform.” HireJungle’s peer-to-peer platform connects people who own practical stuff and have under-utilized know-how with other people and companies who need it. “Here it is in simple terms: If you were to hire out something, let’s say your TV, which website would you use? If you have no idea, that’s because you’re another one of millions of people out there who could be earning income on things you don’t use,” says the founder. The idea behind HireJungle’s platform is that it doesn’t charge users for renting and hiring, and there is no fee for posting classified ads. Instead, the business model relies on advertising, which is a revolutionary step for users in the sharing economy. In this way HireJungle has managed to attract crowds of people who have already uploaded tens of thousands of products, making it the fastest growing rental marketplace in the UK. “There are no fees attached to listing goods and services classifieds (though businesses have pay options for featured ads), because providing commission-free transactions and publications – empowering the crowd – are among the founders’ core values,” remarks an industry expert. And the technology is top-notch, too. Barreneche’s platform offers a social network and adds value by easy, fast tools that drive the platform’s efficiency. For instance, a one-stop website like HireJungle helps hirers to make informed decisions as they can benchmark prices and compare reviews from companies and individuals alike. Product and Services categories are linked in a way that ensures relevant search results, displaying the services classifieds on the left-hand side and the products classifieds on the right. For example, a search query for “builders in London” will not just display results for the builders’ services available in that area, but also building-related products such as drills, ladders, screwdrivers, just to name but a few. So hirers can assess if it’s worth hiring a skilled workforce or rent the adequate tools for a DIY job. Additionally, HireJungle’s Car Hire Price Comparison Engine allows users to compare car rental prices, and in a matter of seconds, users can see the top 500 car hire firms from over 25.000 locations worldwide displaying the cheapest available rates. The eBay-like sharing platform comes with a serious, educational blog that gets the consumer informed on how to rent out in a strategic way. If the consumer knows how to rent in order to save, everyone wins. HireJungle is positioning itself as a leader in segment of an industry that experts say is about to take off. Martin Varsavsky, founder of Madrid-based wifi-sharing platform Fon, says that one of the next big markets for the sharing economy is renting out “expensive DIY home equipment, appliances, expensive gardening tools” and other assets that get little use in their product lifespan. ""We live in a world in which benefits are only accrued through economic growth and the endless consumption of resources,” says Varsavsky. “And that there have to be other ways out there for more people to benefit. Why should everyone have their own car when most of the time they are not using it?” Other startups, like Taskrabbit.com and Rentmyitems.com have recently launched similar platforms. But they have niche focuses: offering exclusively service rentals or exclusively goods rentals – fees apply. HireJungle is one comprehensive solution, letting users rent out their car for the day, or hire a plumber by the hour. Combining goods and services rentals at no cost to the user makes this model a unique one in a market where competition is gaining traction. The sharing economy is booming. Business and Financial magazine Forbes estimated that revenues for the sharing economy could touch $3.5 billion in 2013, growing by more than 25%. HireJungle aims to be at the forefront of that industry in the UK and Europe. And there are plans in the works to expand into India, Canada and the US by 2014. About HireJungle HireJungle’s no-hassle platform is your one-stop-shop for rentals and hiring. And there are no fees to rent and hire out. This project is managed by UK digital agency Join Universe Ltd and is backed by a team of high profile investors."

HiP Property,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hip-property,"FinTech, Real Estate",A NEXT GENERATION ASSET EXCHANGE AND VIRTUAL WORLD FOR REAL ESTATE,"At its core, real estate is plagued by a single fundamental issue; a closed financial loop that forcibly locks single buyers into financing arrangements with single lenders. Even if a property owner only owes 20% of the property’s value in debt, the lender still controls 100% of the property as collateral. In effect, all the money stored in the property becomes a security for the debt, irrespective of the debt size. This creates an ongoing debt culture, restricting the flexibility of owners, even for owners without debt, to realise the wealth stored in their property. Most of all it makes property illiquid – a significant proportion of the world’s real estate wealth sits untapped and inaccessible. This is about to change. HiP aims to be the first to make real estate wealth more accessible at scale by turning equity and debt underlying a property into tradable, interactive assets. HiP aims to develop a system whereby equity becomes a currency and debt levels become a choice. With HiP equity release means selling a percentage of your assets (without losing ownership) to raise money, free of debt."
