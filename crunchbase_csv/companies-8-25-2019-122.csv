On June 7th, 2015 I will begin my professional golf career playing on the SwingThought.com Tour and the eGolf Tour. I played collegiate golf as a member of the Duke University varsity men's golf team. However, I spent a year away from golf pursuing other opportunities in life. I went back to Duke to get my Master's in Management Studies through the Fuqua school of Business. However, over the course of the past year i began to realize that my heart and passion is with Golf. Upon graduation, i had several job offers and i subsequently turned them down to pursue competitive professional golf. At one point in my career I was considered one of the best up and coming golfers in the United States. I had a rather lackluster collegiate career, however my desire and drive for golf has been reborn.   I already have a deal with Titleist as part of their postgraduate players sponsorship. this sponsorship requires i compete in 20 professional events per year for a two year period. This leaves me with needing some funds to cover entry fees and some living expenses. In order to comply with Titleist's requests, I need to raise $50,000. I have already estimated all foreseeable costs and this dollar amount will allow me to comfortably pursue my career.   Furthermore, as long as the donations are not anonymous, I will be offering to payback 10% of my winnings per share as a dividend."

Yakukon,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/yakukon,"Dating, Internet, Mobile Apps, Social Media",Yakukon is an online dating site/app matches people based on their expectations about married life. ,"Unlike traditional dating sites that try to match people based on personality and interests, Yakukon matches people based on their expectations about married life. The site lets users create their own ideal marriage contract and search for compatible partners. Contracts can stipulate anything and everything from childcare and housework, to expected lifestyle and partner income. What is Yakukon Contract? The contract is a detailed document that describes exactly what you can bring to a marriage partnership, and exactly what you expect of your partner. Once done, you search for compatible contracts among other users and other users can search for you. When a user finds a contract they like, they can submit a proposal – a modified (or unmodified) version of their contract – to that user. When users receive a proposal, they can either accept it, reject it, or send a counter offer – an edited version of the proposal they received. Users can go back and forth with counter offers as long as they wish. Once a user accepts a proposal, contact information is exchanged. Then the two users meetup and take things from there. Can I use Yakukon to create a prenuptial agreement? Yes. When you have a successful match on Keiyaku Kekkon, you and your match will have a single unified contract. You can print this out at any time. If you want to make it legally binding, you and your new partner should both modify and sign the final document, ideally with witnesses present. This signed document can then be added to a traditional marriage agreement and approved by your local authorities. Through our system, we hope to make marriage a reality for people frustrated with traditional dating sites. "

Yadget,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/yadget,"Apps, Content, Mobile, Software",Yadget is a mobile application and browser plugin for tagging products and places using twitter style and optionally leaving posts on them.,"The social applications trend is moving towards socializing around common interests and geographic locations rather than just people. This made two guys believe that they can take social networking applications to a next level. They said “why don’t we link the online and the offline worlds and build a social place where people can virtually leave posts and stories on any object or place – online or offline – instead of just posting things about them on websites. These stories can stay there forever and can travel from one person to another”. Those guys developed a social application for that purpose and named it “Yadget”. Yadget is a social network that is centered around objects and geographic locations rather than people. People can find and share content about particular objects and locations by tagging and attaching digital content to them the same way they attach sticky notes to real life objects. We call this digital content “yadgets”. Users can collect yadgets from other users and re-attach them to other objects and locations. They can also create “collections” to organize their own yadgets and the ones they collected. Users can make their yadgets private, public, or accessible to their friends. Yadget changes the way users interact with real-life objects and geographic locations. Using Yadget, users can instantly find and share content relevant to the products they buy, the museums they visit, the food they eat, the magazines they read, the transportation they use, the websites they browse, and other objects and places they interact with in their daily lives. Moreover, users can follow objects, places, or even specific tags of interest to receive notifications whenever new yadgets are attached to them. Users will use Yadget to share posts, stories, memories, events, jokes, recommendations, games, facts, wish lists, reminders, gifts, and many other things."

But the question in the minds of many people is that, whether we should go and buy the diamond jewel now or shall we wait for some more time. If you go and ask this question to any one of the experts who have more experience with respect to diamonds, he or she will definitely ask you to go for the diamond purchase from a diamond jewellery exclusive collection now itself. Even though there are a lot of reasons for this, the most important reason is as follows. It is an obvious fact that the cost of living is increasing day by day and the cost of all the articles, especially jewels are increasing gradually. So, the jewel that is costing 10000 rupees today will surely cost more in future and there is no possibility for the cost of the jewels to be reduced. So we should make use of the opportunity that is available for you. If you want to buy any diamond jewel, then check for any diamond jewellery exclusive collection present in the famous web sites like Yaqsh.com and other similar web sites like that. Once you find a great jewellery shop that has an exclusive collection of diamond jewels, you can go ahead and make your shopping not waiting for the cost to come down. But before making your purchase, prepare an estimate of how much you can spend for the diamond jewel and then make your purchase. You should also consider the shape, and clarity of the jewel that you are going to buy. The color of the diamond is also very important in determining the cost of that jewel that you are going to buy."
