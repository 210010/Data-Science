WORK180,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/work180,"Recruiting, Staffing Agency", WORK180 is a jobs platform with a difference.,"WORK180 (previously DCC Jobs) is a job site which pre-screens employers against a set of 20 criteria, including pay equity, flexible working, women in leadership and paid parental leave. Only Endorsed Employers for Women are allowed to advertise jobs.After spending 10 years in the tech industry, I had experienced both the “boys’ club” work environments, as well as incredible organisations which valued all employees regardless of gender. Throughout my career, when I applied for a new job, as much as I did my research, I had no idea whether it was with a company which supported women.  Frustrated with the status quo and passionate about helping other women who were experiencing similar challenges, the idea of a job site to solve this problem was born.  The sie would have strict rules around the kind of jobs it listed, with an emphasis on pay equity, flexible working, women in leadership and paid parental leave. Not only would they ask these questions, they would make that information publicly available to women, a first for job boards. I called my good friend and previous work colleague Valeria Ignatieva, pictured on the left, to gather her thoughts on the idea. Being a single parent, and facing her own challenges, Valeria absolutely loved the concept. Together, they created WORK180. At a time when diversity in the workplace was becoming recognised as being both fair AND good for the bottom line, large corporations began contacting us to ask for advice on how they could make improvements to their own business.  Meanwhile, they were helping hundreds of women find the roles they deserved, working for companies that valued their contribution. Then, something even more amazing happened. Businesses who did not meet our criteria at first, began changing their workplaces for the better in order to advertise with WORK180. You can read one of their success stories here. WORK180 is now a recognised Australian success story with a broad range of clients, including industry leaders from technology, banking, mining, construction and retail sectors.  Valeria and I have also become vocal commentators on gender issues and they appear regularly on television, radio and web platforms. In their work, they use an inclusive definition of “woman” and “female” to include all women, especially trans women, genderqueer women, and non-binary people who identify as women in a way that is significant to them.​"

A team of physicists, led by Professor Marin Solja developed the theoretical basis for this novel method for wireless electric power transfer in 2005, and validated their theories experimentally in 2007.  The magnetic fields of two properly designed devices with closely matched resonant frequencies can couple into a single continuous magnetic field.  Prof. Solja team showed how to use this phenomenon to enable the transfer of power from one device to the other at high efficiency and over a distance range that is useful for real-world applications.  This âœstrong couplingâ€ enables the devices to exchange energy via magnetism, and avoids the potential safety hazards and inefficiency often associated with radiated electro-magnetic energy. Their demonstration of wireless power transfer showed a 60 watt light bulb being illuminated from a power source over 2 meters away, and their results were published in the prestigious journal Science in July 2007.    Prof. Solja was recognized with a MacArthur Fellowship in September 2008, awarded by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.

Waiakea Water is one of the most alkaline natural waters currently available, with a pH of 8.8 and a TDS of 62. Sustainability - The Process from Start to Finish The source of Waiakea Water has a 1.4 billion gallon per day recharge rate. As a result, Waiakea bottles less than .0001 of 1% of this. Even further, Waiakea uses low-emissions vehicles to transport the water. The bottles that hold Waiakea Water are 100% RPET, which results in a carbon footprint that is 90% smaller than that of traditional plastic bottles, and, recently, Waiakea announced that they would be transitioning to fully degradable bottles in the near future. They are also the only bottled water company to be certified CarbonNeutral®. Ethics - Giving Back Waiakea has partnered with PumpAid to provide clean water to disadvantaged communities. For every liter of Waiakea Water purchased, Waiakea donates 1 week of clean water to those in need in Africa and throughout the world through the help of their partner organization. "

Due to changes in regulation, market structure and investment styles the economics of investor access have changed. The investor access market has been democratized and this has created the demand for a technology based replacement for the manual workflows that until now dominated these interactions.  WeConvene was born out of first hand experience and frustration with the manual investor access workflows. WeConvene is a global SaaS platform that connects all three sides of the capital markets. Our platform is available to Corporates, investment banks, IR firms, brokers, independent research providers and professional investors/Asset managers. Specifically our workflow solution enables our clients to create, manage, promote, execute, discover and analyze any kind of meeting interaction with other capital markets constituents. We deliver an 'OpenTable' like experience to all capital markets participants. As an open platform there are zero barriers to engagement and anyone invited to an investor meeting can book themselves in without creating an account.

Wunderlich Securities,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wunderlich-securities,"Financial Services, Sales, Trading Platform",Wunderlich Securities is a brokerage firm offering equity sales and trading services.,"Founded in 1996 in Memphis, Tennessee, Wunderlich is a full-service investment firm serving the needs of individuals, corporations and institutional clients through our wealth management, investment banking and capital markets divisions. Additionally, we offer inter-dealer institutional fixed income trading services through Fundamental Broker Inter-Dealer (FBI) and operate registered investment advisory subsidiaries. Our firm was ranked among the fastest growing private companies in America by Inc. Magazine from 2010 through 2013. In 1996, then 26-year old Gary Wunderlich coupled his investment banking background with an entrepreneurial vision when he acquired a small broker/dealer in Memphis, Tennessee, and launched Wunderlich Securities. During a time of broad consolidation among the larger, regional investment firms, Wunderlich sought to fill a void with his new venture. Initially, Wunderlich Securities focused only on serving individual investors in the Memphis area. But within two years, the industry took notice and Wunderlich’s Private Client Group welcomed a team of like-minded advisors in Houston, Texas, which became the firm’s first of many branch locations. By 2002, the firm was well-established with 60 experienced financial advisors. Over the next six years, Wunderlich expanded its reach into institutional sales, trading and research with the launch of its Fixed Income division, followed shortly by an Equity Capital Markets division. During this time, the firm’s growth and business model attracted the attention of Coil Investment Group, a Norwegian-based private equity and venture capital firm, which then became a financial partner in 2007. This investment fueled continued expansion for Wunderlich in the years ahead. As the Private Client Group added advisors and new locations in Tennessee and Michigan, the Equity division expanded into investment banking as a result of two banking boutique acquisitions. By 2011, the firm’s equity research effort had grown to 16 analysts following over 200 companies. Considered by this time a full-service financial services firm as a result of a broad offering of individual and institutional services, Wunderlich was recognized by Inc. Magazine as one of the fastest growing private companies of 2010. This honor was repeated again in 2011, 2012 and 2013 as the firm continued to chart steady growth across all divisions. By 2013, Wunderlich’s Private Client Group had surpassed 200 financial advisors with $8 billion in client assets. During that year, the firm received a second capital investment through Altamont Capital Partners, a California-based private equity firm with over $1 billion in capital. Yet another notable milestone was Wunderlich Investment Company’s 2015 acquisition of Dominick & Dominick, an esteemed firm with a history spanning more than a century on Wall Street. This group of advisors continues to serve high-net worth investors from offices in New York, Miami and Atlanta as a division of the Wunderlich Securities Wealth Management division. Within a few months, the firm also added a Dallas-based investment advisory firm, Fiduciary Financial Services of the Southwest, with over $400 million in assets under management to our company. At the conclusion of its 2015 fiscal year in June, Wunderlich had 500 associates working in more than 25 locations across 17 states to manage $10+ billion of client assets. As Wunderlich looks forward to the 20th anniversary of its founding, the firm is committed to the vision that has led to its success thus far – remaining ever diligent in its focus to serve Wunderlich's clients well."

Through their scale and network, they are able to provide oneway taxi rental upto 50% lower than other vendors who charge for roundtrip even for a drop. You can compare different cab rentals on their feedback rating on driver, cabs and agency quality. They intend to organize the fragmented taxi industry under their platform to provide transparent services to all. Well it all started when I could not book a train ticket under Tatkal scheme to attend a family function in Chandigarh and I had to book a cab instead. I just needed a drop to Chandigarh but the vendor charged me for the roundtrip as he wouldn’t get the return fare. Throughout my journey, I felt that it was a massive waste of money, fuel and human resources. Also it somehow didn’t make sense to me why it should be the state of affairs as there must be hundreds of people travelling in opposite direction. Why can they not match these passengers up with these taxis and this would save all the hassle? During the casual chat with the driver, who had grayed his hair in taxi industry, I learnt that the whole industry functions in this manner and they charge for both ways. This got me thinking that this was the high time that somebody stood up and tackled this long pending problem. Thus the core idea behind Wiwigo was formed. At the foundation of Wiwigo platform, they have their rating system that is invitation based so that it cannot be tampered with. The customers who once complete their journey with us are requested to rate their experience on driver, cab and agency on quality. This rating system and upfront pricing creates the much needed transparency. The rating system also encourages cab vendors to improve their services to get better feedback and hence more bookings. This makes their partner cab vendors accountable and reward their great vendors."

Williams Grand Prix Engineering Limited,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/williams-grand-prix-engineering-limited,"Automotive, Innovation Management, Manufacturing, Racing",Williams Advanced Engineering Limited is the technology and engineering services business of the Williams Group.,"Williams Grand Prix Engineering Ltd is founded by Frank Williams and an ambitious British engineer called Patrick Head. The company is based in an empty carpet warehouse in Didcot, Oxfordshire, and enters a purchased March chassis in order to compete in F1 during the latter half of the season.  At the same time it sets about designing a car to contest the 1978 FIA Formula One WorldChampionship with a staff of just 17 people. Frank Williams finds a consortium of Middle Eastern backers to support the team’s efforts and the first car, the FW06, is shaken down at the end of the year with Australian ace Alan Jones behind the wheel.  Williams has won 16 FIA Formula One World Championships (nine for constructors, in partnership with Cosworth, Honda and Renault, and seven for drivers, with Alan Jones, Keke Rosberg, Nelson Piquet, Nigel Mansell, Alain Prost, Damon Hill and Jacques Villeneuve). The team has scored 114 victories, 308 podiums and 128 pole positions.  The team’s endeavours have earned Frank Williams a knighthood, as well as the French equivalent, the Légion d’honneur. The company has two Queen’s Awards for Export Achievement and it’s recognised as one of the most enduring and successful organisations in sport.  Over the years Williams has nurtured many great talents, both in the cockpit and in the design office. The team gave Ayrton Senna his first F1 test in 1983; it was with Williams that Nigel Mansell scored his first grand prix win, in 1985, and his only world title in 1992, and it was with Williams that Damon Hill took all but one of his 22 race victories and the ’96 world title. The list could go on.  Some of F1’s cleverest technical brains also cut their teeth at Williams. The list of Williams’ design alumni includes Adrian Newey, Paddy Lowe, Ross Brawn, Neil Oatley and Frank Dernie, and we’re equally proud of our current technical team led by Pat Symonds - Chief Technical Officer.  Engineering excellence is at the heart of Williams’ DNA. Whether it’s building the carbon fibre chassis of this year’s FW37, or our own eight-speed, seamless-shift, semi-automatic gearbox the team aims to obtain performance and reliability from every component on the car. As a result, it takes a lot of pride in the constructors’ trophies it has won because the constructors’ championship is the most accurate gauge of a team’s performance relative to its rivals. On nine occasions in its history, Williams has beaten everyone.  The team’s business model is unique in the pit lane. While many of the other teams are extensions of multinational companies’ marketing departments, Williams is wholly independent; it exists solely to go racing. Its commercial partnerships must drive value back to its partners’ companies. To meet these expectations, the team has grown exponentially since 1977. What started out as a group of 17 people has mushroomed into a company that now employs more than 600 people at its technology campus in Grove, Oxfordshire.  Williams Advanced Engineering is the technology and engineering services business of the Williams Group. Williams Advanced Engineering provides world class technical innovation, engineering, testing, and manufacturing services to deliver energy efficient performance to the automotive, motorsport, transport and energy sectors. Williams Advanced Engineering specialises in Advanced Lightweight Materials, Hybrid Power Systems and Electronics, Cutting Edge Aerodynamics, Vehicle Dynamics and Holistic Integration capabilities.
