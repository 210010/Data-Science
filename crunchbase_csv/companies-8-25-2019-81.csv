The new millennium marked a turning point for Pixartprinting who addresses the market with the web-to-print formula, thus modifying over the time a traditional workflow into a totally industrial one. At the time it was an innovative business model, implemented in a mature market, which has allowed, during the years, to achieve leadership in Italy, together with a plan to expand across the border.  Pixartprinting is one of the European web-to-print companies for professional customers. It works and produces at the Headquarters located in Quarto D’Altino (VE) which covers an area of 18,000 sq.m, currently employing about 315 employees working in three shifts, thus guaranteeing a 7-day a week service to approximately 80,000 customers in Europe. By 2014 further 12,000 sq.m will be added, making a total production area of 30,000 sq.m. The production area has been designed by implementing the best system now available and is virtually divided in two mirroring production lines: the first line for small size formats and the second for large size formats. In the middle there is the shipping department, where the two chains convey. The small size format area starts from the warehouse responsible for paper stocks, moving to the printing process itself and to the finishing, and to end with the shipping. Similarly, the large size format area has a warehouse for the storage of strong media and spools, develops flatbed and roll to roll printing systems, and moves then to the finishing and shipping processes. Small Size Digital Format When printing multiple sheets for the production of catalogues and books bound with staples, paperbacks fretted or glued in small and medium runs, digital technology continues to be competitive compared to offset. Pixartprinting has recently announced the purchase of four new HP Indigo 7600, which go alongside the four 7500 already installed. The new 7600 are equipped with Automatic Alert Agent, a control system that detects and signals the operator for any differences between the digital file and the machine printed sheet. Also the 7500 already installed will be upgraded to the new models.

Pinnacle Enterprise Business Systems,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pinnacle-enterprise-business-systems,"Consulting, Cyber Security, Information Technology",Pinnacle Enterprise Business Solutions is an IT contracting firm.,"Pinnacle Enterprise Business Solutions is an IT contracting firm established to provide purpose-built technical solutions to public- and private-sector organizations through customer-focused collaborations and investments in our nation’s Veterans. In December 2013, Pinnacle received certification as a verified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). Pinnacle is a Limited Liability Corporation with two business units, IT consulting & engineering services, and vocational rehabilitation services for veterans. IT consulting & engineering services will pursue federal government contract set-s-sides for small businesses and SDVOSBs. Vocational rehabilitation services help Veterans transition back into civilian life and join the private-sector workforce.   Despite the political gridlock in Washington over government spending, funding for the VA has grown in 2015, by nearly 68% from 2009. The politicians understand our nation has a solemn obligation to take care of our Veterans and to honor them for their service and sacrifices on behalf of the United States. To deliver on this commitment, the Federal budget provides $65.3 billion in discretionary funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), a 3-percent increase above the 2014 enacted level.   Pinnacle is poised for success because it will take advantage of current atmosphere in Washington, policies, and initiatives to enter in to the federal contracting business to capitalize on the abundant opportunities set-a-side for SDVOSB. The atmosphere in DC, paves a short path to success for Pinnacle. This plan will show how Pinnacle will breakeven in the first year of business, and become a $25 million company by 2019."
