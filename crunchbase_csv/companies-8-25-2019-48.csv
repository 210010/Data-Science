So the above query could be re-worded as follows: _Select all the images inserted into the datastore in the last 5 minutes and return the list in RSS format_ In addition Jasondb has integrated versioning and non-destructive deletes. This allows for a secure form of editing and audit trails which cannot be modified by either the user or the administrator of the Jasondb account.

Jays Foods,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/jays-foods,Organic Food,Jays Foods manufactures and distributes a full line of quality snacks including its signature Jays Potato Chips.,"The history of the modern day potato chip started in a very simple way. Leonard Japp, Sr. and a friend bought a rickety truck in 1927 for $50 - $5 down and the rest in payments. They picked up their first load of pretzels for $22.50. By 1929 the pair had a fleet of delivery trucks on the road, shiny new frying vats and fair reason to believe the best was yet to come. Then the stock market crashed. Japp proved resilient, however, bouncing back by the mid-1930’s with a new partner and a second go-round at snacks. The pair’s business flourished under their house brand, Mrs. Japp’s Potato Chips, until Pearl Harbor nearly drove them out of business because of the name’s negative connotation. ""We had to rename our company fast. The name Jays was available so we made it Jays Foods,"" Japp, Sr. said. With the potato chips back on the shelves under the Jays name they became Chicago’s premier potato chip. Jays bolstered its position in the market by including recipes on its bags of chips created by Japp’s wife, Eugenia. With his successful business Japp ventured into other snack territories and began manufacturing popcorn, pretzels and tortilla chips. Jays Foods remained under family control until a decision to sell the company was made in 1986. At a 90th birthday party for Japp, Sr. the rumor was that Jays was on the selling block. Leonard Japp, Jr. turned to his father and asked ""Do you want to go back to work?"" To which the elder replied ""Yeah, why not."" So the Japp family reacquired the company in 1994. Jays Foods was born again with the same commitment for quality snacks that has made them the Midwest’s premier snack manufacturer. Today Jays manufactures and distributes a full line of quality snacks including its signature Jays Potato Chips, O-KE-DOKE popcorns, Krunchers! Potato Chips, and a line of Hot Stuff snacks."

He is a licensed Associate Broker with the Pennsylvania Real Estate Commission, and has been an active member in Pittsburgh's real estate community. Jason first moved to the area in 2002 after graduating from college with a degree in Finance.  He began his career humbly; he knew that he lacked the funds to invest in large-scale or high-priced projects, so he sunk the resources he did have into cheap fixer-upper projects in high-potential neighborhoods. Jason's initial efforts in Pittsburgh soon paid off, and he began investing the small profits he made into more expensive projects in vibrant upcoming areas. For Jason Cohen, researching upcoming neighborhoods in Pittsburgh was everything. Jason had a knack for discerning which areas would burgeon to profitability over the next few years - a skill which served him well as a real estate investor in the city. Now, Jason Cohen has dozens of reclamation properties scattered throughout Pittsburgh, and has expanded his real estate investment focus from small multifamily buildings to multi-million dollar commercial projects. His residential investments stand profitably in the South Side, Oakland, Mount Lebanon, Shady Side, and Regent Square. Previously, Jason Cohen even worked with organizations such as the Urban Land Institute, the National Multifamily Housing Council, and the Apartment Association of Metropolitan Pittsburgh.  Now, Jason wants to use his successes and experience to aid others in their professional journeys. An entrepreneur and life-long learner at heart, Cohen founded Jason Cohen Pittsburgh in the hopes that real estate professionals in the city could pool their collective knowledge and experience in a supportive forum for the ultimate betterment of all real estate agents living and working within the city.
