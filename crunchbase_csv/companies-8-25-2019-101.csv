Though a starter on one of the top college soccer teams in the nation, Eddie realized achieving his goal of playing at an elite level required him to improve his technical skills, particularly his first touch. When he learned the National Champion UCLA basketball team often practiced shooting into a smaller-sized hoop, Eddie decided to incorporate this reduced size training methodology into soccer. He began training with tennis balls during his junior year in college, trapping rebounding balls with both feet. Noticing the positive effect this was having on his technique, Eddie purchased a tennis ball machine. This provided mass repetition, accelerating his improvement and putting his game on a trajectory for success. He entered the MLS after his senior year, as a last round draft pick. Three years later, he was named an MLS All-Star and was a starter for the US Men’s National Team. After four years in the MLS, Fulham FC purchased Eddie’s contract, and Eddie joined them the year they won promotion into the English Premier League. Eddie played professionally in Europe for nearly a decade, and competed on the US Men’s National Team in two World Cups. Throughout every step of his career, Eddie consistently employed his small-ball mass repetition training to improve and perfect his core skills. As his 15-year professional career came to a close, Eddie launched TOCA to gives other soccer players the same opportunity to elevate their game. The first TOCA Touch Trainer was a relatively simple machine able to precisely deliver small soccer balls at specified speeds and locations. This has since evolved with years of meticulous testing and research into the cutting-edge turnkey soccer training system of today. In 2013, TOCA opened its first purpose-built Training Center in Southern California. Word of Eddie’s company, machine and program spread fast. TOCA’s Training Centers are now a destination for soccer players of all levels and ages – from complete beginners to members of both the US Men’s and Women’s National Teams. TOCA established its UK operations in May 2017 to bring the TOCA revolution to where the game started. As well as working with elite clubs and institutions, TOCA UK will expand into the grassroots through an entrepreneurial Franchise system."

It also enables software developers to create new communication tools with built-in privacy features. Tor provides the foundation for a range of applications that allow organizations and individuals to share information over public networks without compromising their privacy. Individuals use Tor to keep websites from tracking them and their family members, or to connect to news sites, instant messaging services, or the like when these are blocked by their local Internet providers. Tor's hidden services let users publish web sites and other services without needing to reveal the location of the site. Individuals also use Tor for socially sensitive communication: chat rooms and web forums for rape and abuse survivors, or people with illnesses. Journalists use Tor to communicate more safely with whistleblowers and dissidents. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) use Tor to allow their workers to connect to their home website while they're in a foreign country, without notifying everybody nearby that they're working with that organization. Groups such as Indymedia recommend Tor for safeguarding their members' online privacy and security. Activist groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) recommend Tor as a mechanism for maintaining civil liberties online. Corporations use Tor as a safe way to conduct competitive analysis, and to protect sensitive procurement patterns from eavesdroppers. They also use it to replace traditional VPNs, which reveal the exact amount and timing of communication. Which locations have employees working late? Which locations have employees consulting job-hunting websites? Which research divisions are communicating with the company's patent lawyers? A branch of the U.S. Navy uses Tor for open source intelligence gathering, and one of its teams used Tor while deployed in the Middle East recently. Law enforcement uses Tor for visiting or surveilling web sites without leaving government IP addresses in their web logs, and for security during sting operations. The variety of people who use Tor is actually part of what makes it so secure. Tor hides you among the other users on the network, so the more populous and diverse the user base for Tor is, the more your anonymity will be protected."

Toygaroo solves those problems and more. We are the â€œNetflixâ€ for toys. Members of Toygaroo can visit our website, choose a playtime package that works best for them, fill their â€œtoy pouchâ€ with the toys they wish to receive and we will ship their toys right to their door. The amazing thing about Toygaroo is that when the children get bored with or outgrow the toys they received, the member simply sends back the box using the provided shipping label and we send them their next box of toys.  No more playroom clutter. No more spending money on toys your kiddos will get bored with quickly. No more time wasted driving around looking for the right toys.

Their engine does not use cooling and so it has three times as much energy to work with. The introduction of the supersonic supercharger, the patented key component of Tomorrow's Engine, produces piston-like compression without using any cooling.  So this supercharger has three times as much gasoline energy to work with as gasoline piston engines. With good design, autos can run on 1/3 as much fuel.

And that user interface... Why can’t it be easier to use? Beautiful? Secure? integrated? Intuitive? Mobile? Why can’t your LMS support your vision? It can when you partner with Torch LMS.  Torch is different in 4 critical ways - these are the fundamentals of learning management technology, and they are our obsession:  Your Success, the user interface, user groups, and reporting. Your success is not just an outcome we hope for. We work with you from day one to create and regularly manage a long-term plan. You’ll get consistent pro-active support over years, not just the first months, so you can get every ounce of value out of our technology. We even provide migration services with our implementation consulting so we can do much of the work for you. This makes launching with Torch easier than any other LMS. All of that and a dedicated success manager come together to give you the industry’s best support.  The User interface must be beautiful, custom branded, and easy to use. Our intuitive design will wipe out user error and increase learning engagement. A Torch LMS client recently surveyed their 25,000 users, asking them to independently grade the Torch LMS user experience. In each of the company’s grading categories, their users scored Torch far above the industry benchmark. We scored significantly higher than the “top-tier” LMS that they used before switching to Torch.    User-group management is the heart and soul of automation and reporting, and Torch does this in a uniquely powerful way. User groups can be used to assign training, give access to content, control branding experiences, filter in reports, send communications, display announcements, control admin permissions, and more. Our user-group functionality provides so much flexibility in automation that even the most complex organization will seem simple to manage. Reporting in Torch LMS will simplify and empower your work life. No more manual spreadsheets. Easily make reports as detailed as you want them, including analyzing scorm and custom field data, and schedule regular automated report delivery to any combination of individuals and user groups. You’ll be able to measure impact and share insights like never before. This description only scratches the surface of Torch’s unique functionality.

It's a four-wheeled device with a platform and 2 levers to ride using a strength of user's muscles. The innovation consists of a special mechanism of gears that convert the swing motion of levers powered by hands to rotational movement of wheels. Thanks to this process every user's hands movement (forward and back) is transferred to wheels rotation. We call this activity as a nordic riding, because of similar to Nordic driving hand motion. Using Torqway device is a great opportunity to practice physical exercises, keep good condition and have lots of fun and satisfaction. Torqway's first product - Torqway Sport - has been appreciated on many fairs and invention contests in Poland, USA, Taiwan, and Switzerland in categories: innovation, transportation, fitness, and wellness. These awards have convinced us that we are on a good path and determined us to further development. Currently, Torqway is focused on its new project - Torqway Hybrid vehicle. The philosophy of this product is based on our patented mechanism with gears, but in totally new design and with electric engines support, that help users in breaking most common roadblocks. Manual drive is still basic, but additionally, the user can choose also several assist modes. We strongly believe that Torqway Hybrid will be a great proposal for those, who want to keep fit, attractive and good condition, especially nowadays, when more and more societies become aging societies."

It was originally inspired by the wonderful sub-reddit “Today I Learned“, which is one of their favorite subscriptions on reddit.  There also seemed a decided lack of “interesting fact” style websites out there where the facts presented were well researched. From their experience, most such websites have just as many myths or misleading information presented as facts as they do actual facts.  Today I Found Out‘s goal is to raise the bar on that significantly, providing a site where you know everything on it has been highly researched by amazingly well credentialed authors. Nobody bats a thousand, of course; they have personally encountered numerous errors in some of the best, and most accurate sources for information, such as the OED, Encyclopedia Britannica, Snopes, the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, the QI books (and show), Uncle John’s Bathroom Reader, The Straight Dope, Mental Floss, Neatorama, the Barnhart Concise Dictionary of Etymology, etc. etc.  Again, nobody bats a thousand, but like these aforementioned institutions, they try exceptionally hard to make sure everything posted here is perfectly accurate given the current state of human knowledge when the article was published. As such, TodayIFoundOut.com features near daily “interesting fact” articles from various, extremely well credentialed authors. For more on the current authors here at Today I Found Out, click here.  In the extremely rare instances where something is found on this site that isn’t perfectly accurate, they also re-research the topic at hand and update or clarify some point as necessary."

Since then, Kafka and the ToolWatch team have implemented thousands of customer-suggested improvements and enhancements, culminating in what is today the world’s leading tool and materials management solution.

Top500,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/top500,Communities,"Top500 provides manufacturers and consumers with statics about the performance of PCs, according to the LINPACK Benchmark.","The TOP500 project was launched in 1993 to improve and renew the Mannheim supercomputer statistics, which had been in use for seven years. Their simple TOP500 approach does not define “supercomputer” as such, but they use a benchmark to rank systems and to decide on whether or not they qualify for the TOP500 list. The benchmark they decided on was Linpack, which means that systems are ranked only by their ability to solve a set of linear equations, A x = b, using a dense random matrix A. Therefore, any supercomputer – no matter what its architecture is – can make it into the TOP500 list, as long as it is able to solve a set of linear equations using floating point arithmetic. they have been criticized for this choice from the very beginning, but now, after 20 years, they can say that it was exactly this choice that has made TOP500 so successful – Linpack therefore was a good choice. And there was, and still is, no alternative to Linpack. Any other benchmark would have been similarly specific, but would not have been so easily available for all systems – a very important factor, as compiling the TOP500 lists twice a year is a very complex process. One of Linpack’s advantages is also its scalability in the sense that it has allowed us in the past 20 years to benchmark systems that cover a performance range of 12 orders of magnitude. It is true that Linpack delivers performance figures that occupy the upper end of any other application performance. In fact, no other realistic application delivers a better efficiency (Rmax/Rpeak) of a system. But using the peak performance instead of Linpack, which “experts” have often recommended to us, does not make any sense. They have seen a lot of new systems that were not able to run the Linpack test because they were not stable enough. Therefore, running Linpack to measure the performance is kind of a first reliability test for new HPC systems. The misinterpretation of the TOP500 results has surely led to a negative attitude towards Linpack. Politicians, for example, tend to see a system’s TOP500 rank as a general rank that is valid for all applications, which of course is not true. The TOP500 rank only reflects a system’s ability to solve a linear set of equations, and it does not tell anything about its performance with respect to other applications. Therefore, the TOP500 list is not a tool for selecting a supercomputer system for an organization – centers need to run their own benchmark tests that are relevant to their applications. In this context, an approach such as the “HPC Challenge Benchmark” consisting of seven different benchmarks, which test different parts of a supercomputer, is critical. The TOP500 lists’ success lies in compiling and analyzing data over time. Despite relying solely on Linpack, they have been able to correctly identify and track ALL developments and trends over the past 20 years, covering manufacturers and users of HPC systems, architectures, interconnects, processors, operating systems, etc. And above all, TOP500’s strength is that it has proved an exceptionally reliable tool for forecasting developments in performance. It is very unlikely that another benchmark will replace Linpack as basis for the TOP500 lists in the near future. And in any case they would stick to the concept of a single benchmark because this is the easiest way to trigger competition between manufacturers, countries and sites, which is extremely important for the overall acceptance of the TOP500 lists."
