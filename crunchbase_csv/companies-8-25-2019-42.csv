It was all too often we heard feedback regarding the dull, painstaking and time consuming processes common to their workflows. These individuals were spending countless hours and effort capturing images – only to be left creating mediocre results that still required additional attention in editing software. The need for a refined workflow that would allow individuals to efficiently capture, edit and process high quality images was apparent. The information search began and ended soon after. The conclusion being existing photography software’s were piecemeal, required skilled users and didn’t cater specifically to business photography applications. This led to the development of Shutter Stream Product Photography Software – the world’s first fully integrated image capture, editing and processing software designed for in-house photography. Soon after the release of Shutter Stream, we received feedback from customers telling us the software was perfect for 360 Product Photography. We tailored the software to further enhance picture taking and imaging capabilities for the 360 imaging workflow and integrated a 360 Product View Creator Software. The result being Shutter Stream 360 Product Photography Software. Understanding our customers’ requirements and delivering products to meet these needs has been critical to Iconasys’ success. We aim to continually improve our product offerings to fill the needs of our underserved target market – businesses who require high quality and high volume in house photography. Headquartered in Irvine, California, USA, Iconasys is at the forefront of digital imaging technology. With a strong Management team that is backed by a team of Developers with over 30 years of combined experience, Iconasys is committed to providing customers the highest quality, most innovative offering available in today’s market."

The core values focus on the five areas of people, integrity, performance, pride, and innovation. In a constant effort to encourage the following of ethical practices throughout the company, quarterly awards are given out to employees who best typify the core values in the workplace. In addition to the above areas of focus, the company also places particular emphasis on compliance and security. With a recognition that sensitive data must be safeguarded at every point possible, the company often opts for data compliance checks that exceed those used by competitors in the industry. These checks are audited by third-party specialist FRSecure and are performed by a team of qualified assessors who have a particular focus on the accounts receivable industry. One example of this commitment to additional security compliance is the company’s decision to conduct the PCI DSS 3.2 Report on Compliance rather than the more common, and less stringent, Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard self-assessment."

Ltd.,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/iclinic-healthcare-pvt-ltd-,"Electronic Health Record (EHR), Medical, Messaging, Video Conferencing","iClinic Healthcare offers medical services to its patients, including online consulting, chat and, video calls.","Here is a brief personal background and a detail about iClinic Healthcare. I was, till end 2012, the Chief Commercial Officer for Vodafone India and before that, Operations Director North & East India. I left Vodafone to set up iClinic Healthcare which is a venture aimed at creating an IT platform enabling scheduling and communication and collaboration between 2 or more doctors and patients to allow remote and online diagnosis and prescription. Along with the above IT platform we are signing up specialists and super specialists and creating an ecosystem to serve patients across the world. We will also be signing up general physicians and nursing homes in relevant markets. 1. We will use the above platform and the ecosystem for the following business models:  a. Assisted Remote Consults - to enable Patients in Upcountry markets and in Africa to  consult Super specialists and Senior Specialists based in Metro cities in India.        Patient is assisted by a local Doctor (General Physician)       Patient gets a printed consultation summary from the specialists        and a printed and signed prescription from the local doctor       We are setting these up in independent small hospitals which have general physicians but no real specialists. We have two operating units - in Karnal, Haryana and in Lagos, Nigeria. More are planned shortly in Sirsa, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Mandi etc.   We are also piloting this concept with Corporates who have offices and factories in remote areas. We have tied up with Vodafone and Aircel for these pilots for their offices and guest houses in Ranchi and Guwahati   b. Web based Consults - we are setting up an E-commerce portal that will enable services like Doctor-on-line (24x7), Video call with super-specialist by appointment, offline consult with specialists for seeking 2nd opinions and on-line advice from the comfort of one's home / office. The site is practically ready and we shall be commencing ""beta"" trials in the next fortnight. 2. We have over 55 specialists and super specialists of various specialities signed up and have a tie up with major hospital chains like Max, Fortis, Nova, Global, Medica Synergie etc.  3. We have a very close tie up with Medica Superspeciality Hospital, Kolkata. We not only have over 20 of their specialists on our panel, we are also providing our platform to them to connect their main hospital in Kolkata with their satellite set up in Jamshedpur. Similar tie ups with other large hospital chains is in progress. 4. Our platform allows patients and doctors to save their consultation summaries and uploaded reports so that when they attend a “repeat” consult, they have all the data available in the form of an ERM (electronic medical record.  5. We are now regularly doing consults on our platform - having completed over 150 consults till date - in the last 2 months since we commercialized the concept.  This service is of great value to patients in upcountry places of India – essentially District Headquarters which are far from Metros where all the super specialists and senior doctors reside. The process of “consulting” (like an OPD consult) such senior doctors becomes easy and highly economical and hassle free and time-saving as it precludes travelling long distances for patients. Likewise, for patients based in metros too, our E-commerce site will be of great use to allow them quick and easy and 24x7 access to a medical practitioner and also easily consult senior doctors for 2nd opinions. We are now looking to consolidate all the consultation sites that we have launched and also complete beta trials on our E-commerce platform and launch it in the next 3 months.

Each day huge numbers of people use the iComment button to read and post their opinions, viewpoints, ideas, thoughts, advice and experiences to individual web pages and their content. iComment is based on a central database that ties together user's posts no matter what web page they post it to. The database is extremely relevant because our patent pending technologies enable iComment users to bind their posts to specific keywords or pictures on the web pages of their choice. iComment is based on a single button that appears on the Internet Explorer or Firefox toolbar and enables users to *read and write* comments about web pages as they surf the web from page to page.  Comments  can be made public or only visible to selected people chosen from your buddy list. Users can also access the Global Comment Database by visiting iComment.com and utilizing the iComment search engine. There users can read comments by entering any search term and starting a query. The search results can lead to valuable web pages and to valuable people that have similar interests. Examples of uses-  If you are planning to buy a product or service, use iComment to find out if the product is good. Is it available at a lower cost on another website? Does the seller honor their warranties? Do they ship on time? Is their service good? What was that ""secret bonus"" they sent you when you ordered? On a dating website use icomment to find out if the photo of that dater you are interested in is really her. How old is she really? Or, does HE really have a job? On an auction website comments may include what other bidders are thinking. Perhaps they will share how much they are going to bid? Or, if the seller is legitimate. On a news website use icomment to express your opinions about articles. Is it true? Is it gossip? Maybe you just want to gossip. That's okay too. On a support website use icomment to solve your technical problems. Read how others solved it. Add your own solutions to problems you solve to help others."
