Instead of scheduling an office visit, providers send patients online to complete an evidence based, dynamic and adaptive clinical interview on their mobile device or home computer. Patient responses are processed into a highly efficient format, including automated chart-ready documentation (personalized to each patient's interview), and evidence based treatment recommendations. That means that diagnosis, treatment & documentation by the patient's doctor now take less than 2 minutes of time. When finished, notes go automatically to the provider's EMR, prescriptions go to patient's pharmacy of choice, and patients get an electronic AVS, and scheduled follow-up messaging to ensure that they are improving as expected. SmartExam reduces the time spent on the low-acuity conditions, such as colds, flus and earaches by up to 90%.  Because these types of conditions can make up as much as half of Primary Care visit volumes, this approach can expand medical group capacity by 30%, reduce incremental visit costs by 80%, and grow total margin by up to 3x for provider groups. That level of reduced visit costs make care dramatically more affordable for patients and payers, while still improving margins for providers, and increasing their efficiency by an order of magnitude.

We develop world class lessons based on national curriculums, in-depth teacher training, and support programs and utilize cutting edge wireless technology. Our schools deliver increased learning gains for our pupils by being data driven and evidenced based. Our recent results showed that children get the equivalent of 64 more days of learning in a Bridge school when it comes to reading and 26 days of learning in Maths. We are committed to providing pupils with a meaningful and life-changing education that can enable them to fulfill their potential. We believe that all children should be able to go to great public schools but that sadly that’s not the case at the moment, so we help to bridge the gap. The schools we run are always accountable to government and we have several different models. In some countries, we run very low-cost schools, in others such as Liberia we run partnership schools with the government. High-performing low-cost schools demonstrate that public schools can also be high-performing. Bridge is proving that great education can be delivered sustainably, at scale and within the limited budgets of national economies. Our families chose Bridge because they have seen our results and the difference our schools make to their children and their future."

It’s a place where they build their hopes and dreams, storing them on the wall neat as garden tools. Really, the garage is a hub. A reliable place from which they launch into the world, and enjoy a safe return. They hang out in their garages. Saturday mornings, afternoons, long into the night. Sometimes hosting neighbors, family and friends, other times in blissful solitude, tinkering on projects, obsessing over a problem or making something great. Think of the garages in your past. You’ll remember your dad fixing a lawnmower or building a table, where he taught you to say “Yes, sir.” You can almost smell the oil and beer. But more and more the family garage is an incubator, an enterprise zone. It’s part of the beautiful renaissance happening in the middle of this great country. So it was for Evan Rouse. Evan, from Union, Kentucky, was a pretty extraordinary kid. Because while other kids played video games and started garage bands, Evan fell in love with the craft of brewing beer. And he built a home brewery in the family garage. He was just 16 years old, not even of age."

AI music technology is currently in this state; music goes in, music comes out, and no one really knows what happens in between. Most importantly, other than computer programmers, no one can interact with the technology. Bronze has developed the world’s first platform and UI that allows all music creators to interact directly with AI technology in the most seamless, intuitive and user-friendly way, opening a wealth of creative possibilities.  A small team of AI research scientists, musicians, music producers and music industry figures at BRONZE have spent 10 years working on the system which will fundamentally extend the capabilities of recorded music. It will do this by giving artists the tools to create and release music in ways that aren’t currently possible.  BRONZE is developing two products; composer software which allows people to utilise AI or machine learning as creative tools for composition, and a player which enables artists to release non-static, generative, augmented music.  BRONZE is an AI music system which has been used previously in releases by Gwilym Gold, Jessie Ware and Sigur Rós. However, Jasmine by Jai Paul is the first release to feature an online music player which is able to stream the track. What this means is that releases in BRONZE could be made available everywhere we are currently able to listen to music, which includes all music streaming platforms.   The track, at jaipaul.bronze.ai has immediately attracted widespread, universal praise from fans and peaked interest from hundreds of music creators.

The first target market is greenhouse solar glass, which enables the greenhouse to generate electricity needed for sustaining the internal environment. Using this solar glass, the greenhouse's carbon footprint is significantly reduced as its reliance on externally generated electricity is significantly reduced or eliminated. This is a great value proposition for the greenhouse operator since it reduces the operating cost for the greenhouse by 28% which is currently the cost attributed to energy.  Brite's technology is based on nano-materials which are ink-jet printed on to glass panels, eliminating the expensive and complex production facilities needed to produce traditional solar panels. Variations of the technology will also be used to produce auto-dimming glass as well as architectural glass for building construction."

Brink's was founded in Chicago on May 5, 1859 when Perry Brink purchased a horse-drawn wagon and made his first delivery. The wagon bore his new company's name – Brink's City Express. Chicago was booming, fueled by new railroads built to exploit the growing economy of the surrounding Midwestern U.S. With railroads came manufacturers, distributors, banks and insurance companies, all of whom attracted business travelers to the new city. In the early days, Brink used his single wagon to transport travelers' luggage between Chicago rail stations and hotels. In 1860, Brink's employees delivered luggage and parcels during the Republican National Convention, where an estimated 50,000 delegates and spectators assembled to see local dark-horse candidate Abraham Lincoln win the nomination over other contenders. In 1871, the Great Chicago fire destroyed some 18,000 buildings, including the headquarters of Brink's City Express. Miraculously, Brink's horses and wagons were saved and the company was back in operation within a week. As Chicago recovered, Brink's grew. By 1872, Brink's ran 20 wagons to every part of the city three times a day and had begun service to the prosperous new suburbs. The company advertised fees less than those of competitors: 25 cents to deliver a trunk from a train station to anywhere in the city."

The main idea behind BRI.Tech is all about the treatment of broken bones in children. In dealing with fractures, the use of a stabilizing implant is often unavoidable – and then, after a period of approximately six weeks, when bone healing is in a final state, a second operation is necessary to remove the implant from the growing skeleton. This, obviously, always constitutes a risk and might require another unpleasant hospital stay. Thus, developing a stable implant that dissolves naturally as soon as the bone is able to take over the load again is a major step towards avoiding pain and discomfort. BRI.Tech’s intention is to avoid surgical interventions for implant removal, which helps to reduce costs for the European healthcare system. BRI.Screw is the result of eight years of preclinical research, combined with state-of-the-art materials. BRI.Screw is there to stabilize a fractured bone as long as it is needed in order to support it. Unlike conventional implants, its material dissolves naturally and is excreted by the body as soon as the bone is fully functional again. BRI.Tech was founded in 2016 and is a start-up company located in Graz, Austria."
