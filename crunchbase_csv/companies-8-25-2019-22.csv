However, with the introduction of web-based LMS, Easyclass.com; teachers, professors and students now can have access to all the digital tools they need for learning – and for FREE. Easyclass sets out to disrupt the LMS industry by creating an EASY TO USE, yet powerful software system that will be the new standard for open technology in education.

Eagle's strategy is to acquire and exploit conventional long-life hydrocarbon reserves in certain established production basins in North America. Eagle predominantly owns producing properties with development and exploitation potential. Eagle was formed in 2010 to take advantage of market conditions that allowed Eagle to acquire, operate and exploit oil and gas production and reserves located in the U.S. Over a four year period, Eagle successfully acquired, operated and exploited U.S. oil and gas production and reserves at competitive costs compared to Canada, due to certain conditions during this period, including the U.S. having significantly lower transportation differentials compared to Canadian production, and drilling, abandonment, operating and service costs in the U.S. being lower than in Canada.  During 2014, market conditions in the U.S. caused acquisition prices to increase significantly in the Permian Basin. Management elected to take advantage of these conditions and sold its Permian Basin asset for approximately $CDN 151 million. As market conditions in the Canadian oil and gas industry began to change in 2014, transportation differentials narrowed significantly and valuations became competitive with the U.S. market. In light of these conditions, management elected to expand its operating strategy to acquire and operate oil and gas properties in both Canada and the U.S., thereby taking advantage of market conditions in both countries.  In December 2014, Eagle acquired a 50% non-working interest in one of Canada's premier petroleum producing waterflood properties near Dixonville, Alberta in the Montney ""C"" formation. This was a transformational opportunity for Eagle, allowing the Trust to form a Canadian subsidiary of the business and ultimately enter Canada.  On August 20, 2015, Eagle acquired a private oil and gas company with petroleum producing properties located in the Twining Field in Alberta. The properties are located in one of the largest Pekisko oil pools in the Western Sedimentary Basin, and its portfolio of over 30 drilling locations is anticipated to extend Eagle’s inventory necessary to sustain a current corporate production rate of 3,750 boe per day for over 5 years.  Eagle focuses its acquisition efforts on high quality petroleum producing properties with proven reserves and development and potential. Eagle currently owns properties in Dixonville and the Twining Field, which are both located in Alberta, and Caldwell, Hardeman and Palo Pinto counties in Texas. Eagle does not intend to engage substantially in exploration activities."

Soon customers in areas including New England, the Pacific Northwest, and Alaska were contacting Eastern with requests for customized fishing vessels.

Earthgen Biofuel,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/earthgen-biofuel,"Agriculture, Biotechnology, Food and Beverage, Government",Earthgen Biofuel is an agribusiness who grow non-food agricultural products used in the manufacture of biofuel.,"Earth Gen-Biofuel Is An International Agribusiness  Creating In-Demand Products from Renewable Sources.  The primary business of Earth Gen-Biofuel Inc. (“Earth Gen”) is the cultivation of non-food agricultural products for use in manufacturing processes, renewable energy and transportation fuel.  Earth Gen is the largest U.S. based grower of castor beans in Southeast Asia. The company’s goal is to become one of the largest producers of castor beans in Southeast Asia and other tropical growing areas.  Earth Gen’s management started working in Southeast Asia in 2010 and incorporated as a U.S. company as Earth Gen Biofuel Inc. in 2012 to begin formal operations.  Earth Gen is farming castor beans to satisfy current demands for chemical processes that use castor oil required by chemical conversion facilities in China and by other major importers of castor beans such as Japan, Taiwan, Europe and the United States.   Castor beans are an agricultural crop already in short supply and in high demand for processing manufactured products in many countries and in multiple areas of the economy. Castor bean cultivation has attracted attention as a “renewable energy crop” with high value due to its high oil content in comparison to other oil seed crops.  Earth Gen’s business model is focused on meeting this growing demand without competing against potentially more important food crops by cultivating land for growing castor beans in areas of poor soil conditions where such cultivation does not replace the production of food. As the world supply of castor beans grows along with Earth Gen’s production, the Company will benefit from a “tipping point” created when there is enough surplus castor bean supply to allow for its use as biodiesel.  Based on current commercial demand for castor bean oil and the long term demand for clean fuel, management believes that, subject to obtaining the necessary capital, Earth Gen is positioned for rapid near term and long term growth due to the favorable industry conditions that persist in China, the United States and Europe The concept behind Earth Gen’s operations began in 2010 when Earth Gen’s present management started establishing relationships with farmers, government officials and related agencies in Laos to obtain the necessary local knowledge and expertise with the goal of starting large-scale castor bean cultivation in Southeast Asia. Earth Gen was incorporated in August of 2012 to formalize its business operations. In May 2013, Earth Gen started testing its planting programs in Laos and Vietnam. The purpose of these tests was to evaluate various growing methods and hybrid castor bean types to refine our planting protocol.  In March 2014, Earth Gen started its first large scale castor bean cultivation operations near the city of Xieng Khouang in the northeastern part of Laos.  Between April and July, the Company has prepared nearly 700 acres and completed the planting process, with a projected harvest date starting in September and October of 2014. Earth Gen now has over 1,200 acres and has negotiated agreements to expand to 30,000 acres over the next few years.  Earth Gen first phase 700 acre farm is providing jobs for 50 full time employees and 120 part time employees. Earth Gen is working with local leaders and government in the area of its farms to create programs to benefit the area population with medical services, educational opportunities and other long term programs for support of the area."

Gloves are implicated in 15-18% of all foodborne illness (CDC et al) contributing to over 7,000 sicknesses, 19,200 hospitalizations and 450 deaths every year - costing the economy and business hundreds of millions of dollars in lost production and related impact. 2. Sustainability: The US food sector uses 30 billion PVC vinyl gloves a year. These gloves have been banned or discontinued in most western countries due to carcinogenic chemicals, poor food safety, and serious environmental issues... but not in the US!  Vinyl gloves are thick, wasteful and of inferior strength. They also release dioxin at manufacture and disposal and in many cases contain harmful phthalates, even BPA. We supply a very large US Food retailer with our new tech glove which strengthened their food safety, increased employee satisfaction and reduced their environmental impact by eliminating over 1.2M pounds of glove waste every year. 3. Supply Chain Transparency: The British Medical Association’s In Good Hands report covers labor issues in Southeast Asia’s glove factories. The reports states: ""The manufacture of disposable medical gloves is at high risk for labor rights abuse."" ""...endemic and serious labor rights abuse of workers in factories in Thailand, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka.

However, this need for a known professional many times can be a problem.  For example, if the client is traveling, or has decided for the beauty service at last minute, and the known professional is not available, the customer ends up running out of options. Otherwise, professionals want to optimize their schedule occupation, increase revenue and offer special services such as delivery. Market We're talking about a huge market. Brazil is the third largest cosmetics market in the world, we have a steady growth even in times of crisis (15%/year) , and considering only the women of lower class, they spend an average of U$65,00/month. So we have I very promising market here. The Product See how Easylook works. If you need a professional, you register through facebook and broadcast a new request. For that you have to choose Delivery or Saloon. Let´s suppose you opt for delivery. First you choose your address, which can be your current one or a hotel in another city for example. Then you choose the date and time when you’ll be available, the type of service you are looking for, and sends the request to the Easylook. All active professionals working in the area are notified receiving your request, and if they have availability and interest to assist you, they send you a message thru the application indicating their availability. As soon as you receive those messages, you can evaluate those professionals through the reviews in Easylook app and their profile in social networks, checking which professional is more suitable to you in terms of quality and price.  Once you choose one of the interested professionals, the other professionals are advised that you chose another, and the selected one receive the schedule confirmation.  The professional will come to you at the appointed address, date and time, perform the service, and at the end you can recommend it for other clients posting a review. Development Stage Easylook is a very recent project. We started our ideation process in April/2014. We have started in sep/2014 a pilot in Vitória City (a small Brazilian capital with 2 million habitants).  Our pilot has two phases. The first one, initiated in 1/set focus on activating professionals and builds an initial review database. After that we’ll be able to publish the app to the customers. Our plan is run this pilot until dec/2014 and in 2015 start an expansion to the other Brazilian capitals. At this moment we will need investment to support this expansion."
