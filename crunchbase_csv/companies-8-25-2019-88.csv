Iro, Rachio’s first product, is a smart irrigation controller that is powered by Rachio’s intelligent cloud-based software and is controlled through a web-based dashboard and an intuitive Android or iPhone app.   Iro replaces only the existing control box yet modernizes the entire irrigation system by providing homeowners with a product experience that empowers them to have better landscapes with less time, less water and less money so they can spend more time enjoying their yard. The modern homeowner expects an amazing product experience, current irrigation controllers on the market fall significantly short. The average homeowner is not a trained irrigation expert and they do not have the tools to properly set up and adjust their scheduling.  Traditional controllers encompass little more intelligence than an egg-timer and they represent 95% of all installed irrigation controllers.  They do not enable homeowners to properly set up scheduling and turn on and off on a set weekly schedule with no adjustment to changes in seasonality and weather.  Intelligent controllers on the market are too expensive for mass adoption and are so complex and confusing that they are rarely set up properly.   Rachio solves this problem by leveraging cutting edge technology to provide an amazing product experience that is affordable, easy to use, and truly intelligent.  With Iro, homeowners can choose to have full control at their fingertips or to allow Rachio’s intelligent software to automatically manage scheduling.  For busy homeowners, Rachio can automatically adjust sprinkler schedules, allowing users to have professional scheduling with minimal time and effort.  For the landscape and garden enthusiast, Rachio provides complete control with truly customized scheduling and instantaneous, one-touch sprinkler controls from a smartphone.   Iro is incredibly easy to install and takes only minutes to set up.  During setup, the homeowner’s smartphone sends a signal to the Iro, connecting it to the internet through a WiFi network through which it then communicates securely with Rachio’s cloud-based software.  At that point, homeowners can connect to their yard from anywhere in the world through an intuitive, lightning-fast smartphone app or through a web-dashboard.  With the push of a button, sprinklers can be turned on instantaneously from anywhere in the world.  In addition to fully-customizable and instantaneous control, Iro can be set to automatically adjust irrigation schedules.  Automated scheduling is optimized for water-efficiency and landscape health by taking into account numerous variables including weather, seasonality, landscape characteristics, water budgeting and vegetation.  Additionally, it learns from the customer’s adjustments over time, allowing them to personalize the balance between water use and the “level of health” in each zone of their yards."

Rayner Surgical Group,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rayner-surgical-group,"Health Care, Medical Device",Rayner Surgical Group is manufactures Intraocular lenses and associated instruments used in cataract surgery.,"Rayner designs and manufactures intraocular lenses and proprietary injection devices for use in cataract surgery. When Sir Harold Ridley designed the world’s first IOL in 1949, he chose Rayner to manufacture this ground-breaking invention. With more than 65 years of continuous growth and experience, we remain at the forefront of innovation. We are focused on providing the best IOLs for clinicians and patients and are driven by science to improve patient outcomes and safety. Primary IOLs   Our FDA-approved C-flex aspheric (aberration-neutral) monofocal IOL, as well as our toric and multifocal IOL families are now complemented by the RayOne fully preloaded monofocal IOL injection system.    Supplementary IOLs Designed to be implanted in the ciliary sulcus, Rayner Sulcoflex Pseudophakic Supplementary IOLs are available as aspheric, toric, multifocal and multifocal lenses, and offer a reversible solution for correcting residual post-operative refractive errors following the implantation of a conventional IOL in the capsular bag. OVDs Our Ophteis range offers a full spectrum of OVDs from dispersive to cohesive, enabling surgeons to select the OVD best suited to each specific cataract procedure. Ophteis FR Pro with sorbitol -- designed to deliver a new level of corneal endothelial protection from phaco induced trauma -- is the flagship product of Rayner’s ‘Ophteis’ OVD suite.  Pharmaceuticals Although the intraocular lens plays a leading role in the visual outcomes of cataract and refractive surgery, the pharmaceuticals that manage the tear film and inflammation are critical to the end result. For that reason, Rayner recently acquired the business of Moorfields Pharmaceuticals. The acquisition will enable us to offer an even wider range of ophthalmic tools that aid and streamline the surgical process whilst remaining focused on the visual outcome for the patient.   Rayner markets its IOL portfolio and related products worldwide through a network of distributors in over 80 countries with direct markets in UK, Germany & Austria, the United States of America, Italy and Spain. We have the world’s longest commercial history of IOL design and manufacturing and have worked with cataract surgeons for longer than anyone else. In 2016, Rayner transferred its global headquarters to a brand new state of the art manufacturing plant, which has dramatically increased the company’s production capacity."
