The company expects to launch its first product, Vu-Path, in late 2016 under a 510(k) class II submission.    Physicians use several different techniques to perform minimally-invasive procedures, such as line placements, aspirations, and therapeutic injections. Interventional options include open surgery or image guidance by surface ultrasound, CT, X-Ray, and MRI. However, these techniques can be expensive, inconvenient, risky, and may not be usable for the critically ill. For example, current surface ultrasound systems are difficult to maneuver, do not apply to “difficult cases,” and inadequately detect the tip of the needle or catheter, potentially leading to puncture of nearby structures and organs. The high cost and substantial training requirements of existing imaging solutions have greatly limited acceptance.    Vu-Path addresses the current unmet need by quickly, safely, and precisely accessing organs and internal structures. The patented core technology is unique in integrating a forward-viewing imaging element that allows accurate and precise placement of a probe’s tip. Perceptive’s first product, Vu-Path, will be the first intracorporeal (“within the body”) ultrasound probe that does not occupy a lumen in the body (such as the esophagus). This composite probe combines ultrasound imaging with a versatile portal that can be used for introducer needles, biopsy needles, guide wires, or the delivery of therapeutics. By replacing surface ultrasound, CT, X-Ray, and MRI in complex surgical and percutaneous procedures, Vu-Path will shorten procedural times while reducing staff needs, facility requirements, and equipment costs."

Penn & Teller,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/penn-teller,"Digital Entertainment, Event Management, Events",Penn & Teller is an eccentric magicians and entertainers  with a psychotic twi.,"They defy labels, and at times, good taste. They've performed together for 30 years; skewering the genre of magic, their sold-out audiences, and themselves -- very often all at the same time, within one mind-boggling evening. September is an exciting month for the duo as they celebrate their fifth year as headliners in their own theater at the Rio All-suite Hotel & Casino, as well as two Emmy nominations for their Showtime series, ""Penn & Teller: Bullshit!"" And along the way, Penn & Teller have made the hardest trick of all a remarkable career that ranges from stage to television to three best-selling books look easy. And they've done it all on their own, distinctively offbeat terms. They call themselves a couple of eccentric guys who have learned how to do a few cool things. Since first teaming up in 1975, when they combined Teller's silent, occasionally creepy, magic with Penn's clown college education and juggling expertise, the two have created an entertainment success story that went from the streets to small clubs to national theater tours, and now to a current, multi-year engagement at the Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. By 1985, Penn & Teller were receiving rave reviews for their Off Broadway show and Emmy award-winning PBS special, Penn & Teller Go Public. In 1987, they began the first of two successful Broadway runs. Penn & Teller had national tours throughout the 1990s, gaining critical praise from New York to San Francisco for bringing a fresh slant to an often-tired show business realm. The first of more than 20 appearances on Late Night with David Letterman soon followed, along with appearances on a wide range of television: The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Miami Vice, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Hollywood Squares, The Today Show, Saturday Night Live, The Drew Carey Show, Friends, Dharma & Greg, Home Improvement, and one of television's most honored rolls: animated guests on The Simpsons. They also created their own television projects, including Penn & Teller's Sin City Spectacular, Penn & Teller's Home Invasion, the Showtime movie Penn & Teller's Invisible Thread, and the NBC specials Don't Try This at Home and Penn & Teller: Off The Deep End. Penn & Teller made their big screen debut in Penn & Teller Get Killed and were featured in Walt Disney's Fantasia 2000 . In 2005 Penn & Teller lent their version of the world's dirtiest joke to the critically acclaimed documentary, The Aristocrats. The film, produced and co-created by Penn, is now available on DVD. Penn & Teller's understanding of magic and their ability to relate to audiences has also garnered serious academic attention. They serve as Visiting Scholars at MIT, that school's highest honor, and have lectured at Oxford University and the Smithsonian Institution. In 2001, they received the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award. Penn & Teller have written three best-selling books, Cruel Tricks for Dear Friends, How to Play with Your Food, and How to Play in Traffic; and penned pieces in outlets ranging from The New York Times to Playboy."

This service provides social access through warm introductions. Pearescope users do not need to subscribe to another social network, rather, this service enables existing networks to come offline and into the real-world with a self-regulated balance of privacy and connectivity.  How it works: Users set their ""spotlight"", the area in which they wish to be seen around their smartphone, and apply their social networks to that geographic area. Users may also define their ""surface time"", the duration in which they want to be actively networking with those nearby. ONLY when their spotlights and surface times of two users overlap, and both share a mutual connection, will Pearescope send an icebreaking text message to both members: ""John, Jane is in your spotlight who also knows your friend Jon Smith."" Why its different: Pearescope is check-in free and private.  This service provides social access through mutual connections. Pearescope allows users to cherry-pick the most important and meaningful relationships from their second network through a demographic filter. Such filters include gender, school, and relationship status. Its patent pending technology only alerts members if both are within each other's spotlights. For example, if Jane sets her spotlight to 5 miles and Jon sets his to 500 feet, both would only be introduced if Jane was inside Jon's spotlight."

That’s not because companies haven’t recognised how important these visitors are – it’s just that there has been no great way to do it. For so long companies have focused on ‘knowing the customer’ before they can personalise to them. With GDPR and people becoming much more cautious over sharing data it has become harder to personalise to website visitors as companies know less about their visitors. Even when there is a lot of data available on customers it still takes considerable time within a company to segment their visitors and then manually create the user journeys for each of these segments. Personalisation takes a lot of time and a lot of decisioning – why couldn’t all of this be automated? The Personify Anonymous Experience platform is the first platform to focus exclusively on anonymous visitors. Our AI platform connects great products with shoppers you know nothing about through automating how content and products are shown to which shoppers and when.

Pelago,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pelago,"Mobile, Shopping, Software","Pelago offers Whrrl v2.0, an app that enables people to capture and share moments, as they happen, in story form.","Pelago was founded by former Amazon executives in 2006 based on the belief that three key trends, (1) pervasive location-awareness, (2) perfect information, and (3) people as media, will converge to create an opportunity for life-changing innovation. Pelago's mission is to remove all barriers to inspiration, information and human connection. Pelago's most recent product, Whrrl v2.0, enables storytelling in our daily lives. Launched in March, 2009, it is a mobile and Web application that enables people to capture and share the moments of their lives, as they happen, in story form. Through location, photos and text updates, users can easily turn everyday life experiences into lasting stories that can be remembered, organized and shared. The user controls exactly who can see his or her story, ranging from total privacy to publicly visible, including optional broadcast via status updates on Facebook and Twitter. Whrrl v2.0 is available now as a free application through the iPhone App Store, and anyone can participate via the Web, SMS text, and digital cameras with an Eye-Fi wifi-enabled memory card. Whrrl v2.0 stories are collaborative: two or more people who are physically together can â€œjoinâ€ and contribute to the same story from their separate phones, allowing a single shared experience to be expressed from multiple points of view. In addition, each story has its own unique URL that can be easily shared. After the real-world experience ends, the story may be edited by the participants via the Whrrl website and shared with others through Facebook, Twitter and/or email. Whrrl v2.0 on the iPhone utilizes Facebook Connect for Mobile to allow Facebook users to bypass Whrrl v2.0 account creation and login with their Facebook accounts. Linking a Facebook account to Whrrl v2.0 also enables access to the userâ€™s Facebook friends list, ability to publish stories as status updates, and all photos taken through Whrrl can be automatically published to Facebook photos. For non-iPhone users, Pelago provides several ways to participate in Whrrl v2.0. First, any mobile phone user can create and update stories by sending SMS text and email messages. Second, people who own a digital camera and an Eye-Fi wireless wifi-enabled memory card can upload pictures taken with the camera in real-time to a Whrrl v2.0 story. Finally, anyone can visit the Whrrl v2.0 website (www.whrrl.com) to view and comment on stories."
