First Use Case is the world's first true AI Psychotherapist.","Most conversations with a chat bot are quite prescriptive and don't really ask questions but just prescribe answers to you.  The issue is that, as humans, we are wired to ask a LOT of questions and our brains work with ambiguity - fresh ideas, new thoughts, a change of mind - all of these things guide our conversations.  But AI still doesn't cope too well with this. In 2009, we began work on a psychological framework that invites you to stand at the center of your own knowledge and experience; understand what's going on inside it; and take action.  Our proprietary psychology platform works through cognitive linguistics and embodied cognition, and is based on Nobel Prize-winning theory. To make this technology accessible to everyone, we have developed our own proprietary communications engine built on Natural Language Understanding (a 'hard' part of Natural Language Processing).  This engine focuses on asking questions as the technology strives to 'understand' what you are looking for.   Whereas AI can be built around large decision trees and statistical probability, our technology is specifically founded on 'not knowing the answer'. Our primary Use Case of this IP is ""Litha"" - the world's first true AI psychotherapist - specialising in speaking with people dealing with anxiety or mild-moderate depression. Litha is able to engage in and transcribe free-flowing unstructured conversations as she guides you through the therapy process. _______________________________________ From an investment perspective, Litha is addressing a $1 trillion global corporate issue of non-productivity due to anxiety or mild-moderate depression (UK market is c. $43bn; USA market is c. $300bn).

However, at present, there are zero products on the market that provide AI psychotherapy. In addition to this, the wider issue of psychological safety in the workplace has causal links to non productivity and innovation.  We are already exploring the financial impact of poor psychological safety and its links to ethics, team cohesion, resistance to change, etc.   Litha is in the latter stages of the Lab and is having unstructured psychotherapy sessions via a Slack Channel as well as via Google Assistant and Alexa.

Early on, the company entered into key partnerships with meta travel search sites Kayak and Hipmunk, demonstrating significant top of funnel demand and favorable customer acquisition cost.  In 2017, marketplace billings were $4.5 million.

Nowadays, there is a growing number of scenarios -in- house domestic applications, traffic lights, hospitals, hotels, etc.- where illumination devices based on visible LED lamps are used. This interest is not only motivated by economic reasons (as the price of individual lamps is still higher than that of traditional ones, although it is rapidly becoming cheaper and cheaper) but by energetic or environmental considerations. These lamps combine very low power consumption with an extremely long operational life, maintaining during all their operation the same chromaticity without significant changes. LED lamps can be also used as communications emitters without losing their main functionality as illumination sources. This technique (known as Visible Light Communications or VLC) does not only maintain the usual capabilities of wireless optical transceivers (robustness against EM interference, absence of EM compatibility constraints and secure transmissions as radiation is confined by walls) but is also eye-safe (as it uses visible wavelengths). Additionally, as they are used as lamps, the amount of optical emitted power is enough to provide full transmission coverage over a regular size room.

People trust referrals from friends and family more than those from strangers. Sometimes knowing who is making a recommendation is just as important as which businesses theyâ€™re recommending. LikeList helps you get more value from your trusted local businesses. By â€œlikingâ€ businesses, or putting them onto your TryList, you create a way for them to share special promotions, coupons or other deals with you. LikeListâ€™s local online services make us a natural champion of local communities and their economies. Locally owned businesses make stronger communities. $45 of every $100 spent with a local business stays in the community, vs. $13 of every dollar spent with a national chain.1 So, Whatâ€™s in it For You? What if you could get five recommendations for quality local auto mechanics from all of the people in your personal network, and at the same time see offers and coupons from them? What if you could plan a weekend trip to the North Shore of Lake Tahoe and, in one click, see which hotels, rental properties, snowmobile tours, restaurants and evening dance or blues places your friend or group of friends like and highly recommend? What if you could access the local knowledge of your friends, neighbors and acquaintances 24x7 for anything you might need near or far from home? LikeList saves you time, money and worry. 1Small-Mart Revolution: How Local Businesses are Beating the Global Competition, Michael H. Shuman, 2006 LikeList is funded by venture capital firm Syncom Venture Partners which specializes in media and communications business investing particularly in underserved markets."

On the demand side we serve independent mortgage lenders who need short term funds to finance the mortgages they originate from time of funding until sale to the permanent loan investor.   Our online exchange makes it simple for the mortgage lender to upload a data file of collateral that they wish to use to obtain financing.  The loan data and the collateral trust receipt are uploaded into our proprietary exchange system, X-Spot™.  Once the lender submits the collateral for financing bid, X-Spot™ validates the data through a network of internal and third-party data providers.  We also incorporate CoreLogic’s LoanSafe product which appends to the collateral data file a Collateral and Fraud Risk score.  These scores as well as any of the collateral data is searchable and filterable through X-Spot™.   On the supply side, an investor simply funds a trust account and completes one or as many bid profiles they desire.  Bid profiles are simplistic yet they have the ability to be as granular as the investor desires.  These profiles determine which collateral is eligible for a bid from the investor.  The investor bids a desired participation percentage, a cash advance percentage and an interest rate.  All of this can be done globally or at an individual transaction level.   X-Spot uses proprietary algorithms to match credit profiles and participation bids.  The lender is provided three choices – optimize for cash advance, optimize for interest rate or utilize X-Spot’s proprietary optimization.  We also have a third party who provides first loss coverage on the loans providing further credit protection for the investors.

LilyDrive,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lilydrive,"Advertising Platforms, Software",Native ad platform for cause marketing,"From GeekWire article 12/15/2014: LilyDrive connects online content with the most relevant non-profit organization, allowing users to quickly and easily donate. For example, if a news website posts a story about dog adoption in your city, LilyDrive gives publishers a way to embed a small widget — similar to social media buttons — that lets readers donate money to a relevant organization and share the story and their contribution with friends. LilyDrive CEO Harrison Magun said that the fresh funding will help the startup build upon some early traction with publishers and users. The company recently launched with its first medium-sized online publisher, Good News Network. The money will also help LilyDrive figure out how to make its own revenue — the company does not take a cut of any donation made via its platform. “When people donate to a cause, they don’t want part of their good deed to be someone else’s business model,” Magun explained. Magun said the monetization strategy is to “be a native ad platform for enterprise cause marketing.” He noted that despite Fortune 500 companies donating to charity more than ever, customers still expect them to contribute more time and money. “At LilyDrive we think the problem isn’t that companies necessarily need to spend more on charitable causes — in fact, companies have never given greater amounts,” Magun said. “The problem is that, despite clear consumer demand, it’s really hard and expensive for companies to advertise their good work in a way that engages with customers and is cost effective.”"

By the Fall of 1994, heading home from a long, less-than-fruitful roadtrip, Bert and John were desperately searching for answers to keep the dream alive. Little did they know, the only answer they needed was back in Boston, hanging up on their apartment wall. Jake's contagious grin, simple as it was, seemed to express everything the Jacobs brothers believed in.    One fateful September day, they printed up 48 Jake shirts for a local street fair in Cambridge, Massachusetts. They laid the shirts out on their rickety card table. By noontime, all 48 of those tees were gone. A star was born."
