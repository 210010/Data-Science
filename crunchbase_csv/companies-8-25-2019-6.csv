With the global population projected to reach nine billion by 2050, agricultural output must increase by 70% in this timeframe. As nations such as the United States pursue agriculture-intensive energy policies, demand and price volatility for agriculture commodities will continue to intensify. Diminishing agricultural resources such as arable land and fresh water will further compound this challenge.In the last twenty years, crop yields have improved from intensive breeding programs, increased planting densities, and biotech traits such as insect resistance and herbicide tolerance. However, blockbuster trait releases in recent years are only having single digit percentage impacts on yield. At a time when step changes are needed in crop productivity, yields are plateauing. One contributing factor to the decline in crop development is that nearly all commercial biotech traits are single-gene approaches to protecting yield. But to realize step changes and avoid a yield plateau, we must innovate beyond single-gene approaches to protecting yield, and realize step wise gains by increasing intrinsic yield. Benson Hill is dedicated to delivering substantial production gains to the agriculture sector by advancing biotech-based traits to increase intrinsic yield."

Founder Damien Patton didn’t realize that his friend, a fellow soldier from Desert Storm, was also in the airport — despite their being mere feet from each other. Damien vowed to figure out a way of ensuring people were up to date with news and information, as well as location. So, he designed an app at the intersection of social media and location, that would ensure you never missed out on the people you care about. Winning a Google hackathon soon after gave Damien the funding and momentum to make Banjo a reality. He moved to Silicon Valley and created Banjo in 2010. In 2013, Banjo opened a second office in Las Vegas, NV. Banjo has evolved immensely since its conception. What started as an app for finding friends nearby has become a platform with the rare ability to transport people all over the world, right from their mobile device. Though we still own the intersection of location and social content, Banjo has strayed from its focus on ""here"" or ""near me"", and re-focused on the great beyond: ""there"". Far more interesting than the familiarity around you is the great big world beyond it. And Banjo takes you there. Banjo's team has expanded to more than 30 employees, and is working harder than ever to revolutionize the world by creating a live internet. We aim to be the best at what we do: collecting social posts from all around the world, doing so before anyone else, making them relevant through location, and presenting it all in an informative and entertaining way."

This enables a clear calculation of the taxable crypto income and an acceptance of the tax return by tax consultants. Crypto traders are often unaware of taxes on profits. Regular trading makes it difficult to keep track of the individual trades. This is mainly because every single transaction, including the exchange within crypto currencies, must be valued as a taxable event. If the tax office requests a declaration or proof, it will be difficult to provide this afterwards.   This is where Blockpit's software solution can help. The monitoring platform automatically records all sources of income and creates a clear log. Every single transaction is imported and guarantees a daily documentation of all trades. In addition, the user receives an overview of the development of his portfolio and information on taxable profits and speculation periods. Alarms for events such as value changes can be set in the system. The ""Tax tips"" option provides suggestions for tax optimization and information on regulatory changes in the crypto area. Blockpit has built up a worldwide network of licensed tax advisors who can check and approve the documentation on request. This eliminates the risk of supplying false data to the tax office and therefore of being prosecuted for the crypto dealer."

Bright.md,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bright-md,"Enterprise Software, Health Care, Information Technology, mHealth, SaaS",Bright.md builds software that cuts the cost of healthcare visits by up to 80%.,"Bright.md’s SmartExam is a virtual physician assistant that helps primary care groups automate up to 90% of provider time spent on low-acuity conditions, such as colds, flu, and earaches, that often make up more than half of their visit volume. Instead of scheduling an office visit, providers send patients online to complete an evidence based, dynamic and adaptive clinical interview on their mobile device or home computer. Patient responses are processed into a highly efficient format, including automated chart-ready documentation (personalized to each patient's interview), and evidence based treatment recommendations. That means that diagnosis, treatment & documentation by the patient's doctor now take less than 2 minutes of time. When finished, notes go automatically to the provider's EMR, prescriptions go to patient's pharmacy of choice, and patients get an electronic AVS, and scheduled follow-up messaging to ensure that they are improving as expected. SmartExam reduces the time spent on the low-acuity conditions, such as colds, flus and earaches by up to 90%.  Because these types of conditions can make up as much as half of Primary Care visit volumes, this approach can expand medical group capacity by 30%, reduce incremental visit costs by 80%, and grow total margin by up to 3x for provider groups. That level of reduced visit costs make care dramatically more affordable for patients and payers, while still improving margins for providers, and increasing their efficiency by an order of magnitude. All this happens through a beautiful online tool, that delights providers and patients, without the patient ever having to come into their doctor’s office."
