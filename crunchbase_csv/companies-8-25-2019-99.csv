To address the growing challenges in software development and the increasing demands of clients looking to enhance quality levels, they have been looking for new opportunities and methods to enhance the functionality and user-friendliness of apps, websites, etc. Thanks to an increasingly digitalised world, crowdsourcing, which is the sourcing of tasks to a global online community, has found its place in the business world and especially the IT industry. The application of this new form of labour to software testing resulted in a new, innovative method known as crowdtesting. A major benefit of crowdtesting is the opportunity to have not only experts but also unbiased consumers performing software tests on their own devices and under real world conditions. This grants access to a nearly endless combination of devices, operating systems and software. Another advantage of this method lies in the selection of testers, who can be chosen based on numerous criteria and characteristics that reflect the product’s target group. Crowdtesters are available ad-hoc via the internet and ready to search for defects and usability issues without encountering operational blindness. As a result, businesses are provided with a huge amount of flexibility in allocating their resources. They were able to quickly convince their first clients and investors about the numerous benefits and opportunities of crowdtesting. In addition, the Federal Ministry of Economy and Technology (now Economy and Energy) recognised their business model’s potential and funded Testbirds in the form of the EXIST scholarship as well as the start-up competition, “IKT Innovativ”."

Terminal.com,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/terminal-com,"Cloud Data Services, Computer, Security, Software",Terminal provides bleeding-edge software and AI to edtech companies looking to improve student success.,"We built a hypercloud with bare-metal performance.  A hypercloud is a 100% software configurable virtual datacenter that lives on top of physical hardware securely in your private datacenter, on the public clouds of AWS, GCE, and Azure, and on your laptop. Virtual Machines tax performance.  Containers are too new and insecure, forcing you to redesign app deployment flow. The hypercloud unit of computation is the Terminal Machine (TM, or just Terminal).  TMs are the best of both worlds: you get the security and familiarity of full operating system instances with the bare-metal speed and efficiency of containers. TMs rebalance and migrate seamlessly without reboot to maximize efficiency of your cluster.  Terminals resize from 1 CPU to 32 CPUs and 50GB of RAM when you need the power, in seconds, with no reboot. They automatically pause or shrink back down to save you money. “The software-defined data center is 10 years away,” they say. “The public cloud is too insecure,” they say. The hypercloud is the best of both worlds: you get the abstraction and power of the cloud, with the security of running everything in your own datacenter, plus the benefits of a hybrid cloud if you want both. Today. Who uses Terminal.com? Our users range from web app developers who spin up copies of their website in 5 seconds for QA and testing, to neuroscientists who analyze large FMRI datasets on computers that scale instantly, to online schools who teach people how to code using Terminal.com.

Engineers across Silicon Valley know that Terminal.com is the easiest and most powerful tool for conducting coding interviews. Terminal.com provides the full suite of tools for the modern developer. How did Terminal.com start? When Varun Ganapathi’s family moved from India to Boston, Massachusetts in the 1980's, they started a small company called Terminal Exchange Systems. The company provided terminals to local companies so that they could remotely access huge, main-frame computers. Varun Ganapathi helped his father carry machines door to door, renting out both the hardware and software to local businesses. As he grew up, Varun’s commitment to computing didn’t disappear. He completed his computer science PhD at Stanford, sold over 1 million copies of his paid photography mobile app, Pro HDR, and sold his second company, Numovis, to Google. After two years as a Google Senior Research Scientist, Varun asked his father if he could use the company domain name, Terminal.com. Varun explained that he had plans for it, but this time there would be no need to carry hardware door to door. Today, Varun and his San Francisco-based team rent out browser-based virtual machines that they call Terminals to thousands of users across the globe giving them access to the infinite resources of the cloud. Users ranging from online education students to Dev-Ops professionals can now start, resize, and scale their own Terminals in a matter of seconds. Inside each Terminal, they discover an intuitive interface for creating, editing, and sharing programs. And they don’t even have to wait for them to be delivered to their door."

To wit, it’s a daunting challenge and the obvious needs of the various ecosystems across the continent are currently met only by local (English-language or not) blogs and news sites, and larger publications that tend to scratch only the surface, focusing mainly on the happenings in major hubs such as London, Berlin, Paris, Helsinki, Stockholm and Tel Aviv.  They feel strongly that the broader European tech scene deserves something more. They believe that there is a clear unmet need for a publication to go both deep and wide and deliver data-driven analysis, news with nuance and context, opinionated but thoughtful commentary, combined with solid research.  They also believe there are certain regions in Europe, primarily (but not only) emerging markets in central and Eastern Europe, that are currently being underreported on. Too many great stories are being left untold, and they think the broader, global tech community would benefit if that They aren’t the case.  They are a team of writers and entrepreneurs with a knack for quality reporting. They’re devoted to highlighting the innovation that is happening all across Europe, and reporting on the trials and tribulations of its technology industry from a big-picture perspective."

Terminal.global,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/terminal-global,"Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Ethereum, Financial Exchanges, Software",Building the 'bloomberg' of crypto,"Vision Terminal is an informational-analytical platform with trading functionality for cryptocurrencies. It is a web-based platform, allowing to trade on over 40 exchanges worldwide, thus providing access to 1000+ trading pairs, from a single, user-friendly and intuitive interface.  Terminal is built to do 3 things well: provide in-depth analysis of various blockchains, data from exchanges, and crypto-related internet traffic (in partnership with Similarweb).  Example use-case: August 2017, BTC fork into BTC and BCH. On the surface, during the 20 day period following the fork, btc price was relatively stable, yet the price of bch was rapidly rising. Under the bonnet, however, we know from publicly available data that the number of outstanding unconfirmed transactions in the btc chain was constantly on the rise, due to the fact that global mining power redistribution happening at that time geared miners towards mining bch as it was more profitable. At the same, you would see a spike of interest in bch through viewing aggregated trading volumes from over 40 exchanges in all bch pairs. Mentions of bch in social media and generally on the internet has been increasing during that same period too. Terminal wants to deliver this kind of analytics in real-time, so that traders can make informed and weighted decisions, using the charting suite developed in-house. Terminal positions itself as content aggregator and information provider. Thus, it entails extra functionality, such as news, ICO ratings aggregation, mining sections, arbitrage matrices in real-time, market pulse snapshot screens, crypto indices tracking, universal blockchain explorer, calendars and much more, becoming the go-to place for crypto enthusiasts. As such, Terminal aspires to become for crypto-market what Bloomberg has become for traditional markets, with the only difference – it is free. We believe that in the world of crypto, unlike the traditional financial markets, information is essentially free and transparent, and with increasing volumes of this information on a daily basis, there needs to be a tool that makes sense of all this data – this is our mission for the Terminal. Terminal is used to trade, research, analyze, track crypto-markets from top to bottom. We strongly believe the crypto markets will grow in size, and more people around the world will get involved, so we are building a multi-language all-in-one global tool to satisfy the needs of crypto-involved ever-growing audience. A new asset class is emerging in front of our eyes, there are big opportunities ahead. Founder"
