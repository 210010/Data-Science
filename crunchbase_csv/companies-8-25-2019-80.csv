Moreover, borrowing money for your real estate project is much faster and easier than applying to the bank. We bring together people who want to invest in real estate and people on the other side – those who are looking for money to implement their real estate idea. The idea of PROFITUS developed slowly. When working with real estate buyers and sellers and developing real estate projects, more and more people were asking about the possibility of investing their money in real estate. And we have in mind not necessarily large sums of money. To keep money in banks is not a solution because nowadays banks do not pay interest, and investment in shares, with no specific knowledge of this area, is very risky. Yet, real estate is a tangible thing, it protects your money from inflations – in short, real estate is a solution you were looking for. And one more thing – imagine, your real estate constantly generates additional income. Nothing can be better! However, to be able to buy an apartment or commercial premises, renting them and getting those passive income requires a substantial initial contribution. So, what to do? Here the idea of PROFITUS was born – to unite people and give them the opportunity to invest small amounts of money in real estate, to become partners in real estate projects or to implement their own real estate projects. At present, due to the Monetary Promotion Policy of Central Banks, the market has accumulated a large amount of savings: in banks, socks, unworthy deposits. So it’s no surprise that a person who cares about his future understands that money must works – to generate cash flow for the future. Such person wants to make profitable and secure investments. PROFITUS provides such people with the possibility of investing money in real estate and obtaining additional income. Our platform changes the rules of the real estate market. Real estate is considered one of the safest investments, which is: – Inflation-resistant – Creates additional income – Tangible, it is a physical object! PROFITUS collects money from investors and then funds a real estate project. To be truly secure – the investment is protected by the pledged assets of the project owner. And all this can be done ONLINE! No need to leave your home – what is happening with this word? :) Join us and together we will change the approach to investing in real estate!"

PriceMDs.com Inc.,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pricemds-com-inc,"Health Care, Medical, Shopping",PriceMDs.com is Where America Shops for HealthCare.,"PriceMDs.com, Inc. is a Florida-based healthcare insurance technology company which offers surgical benefit management solutions for self-insured insurance plans and their beneficiaries.  The Company’s proprietary technology platform enables private and public sector employers with self-insured healthcare plans to significantly reduce the cost of outpatient surgical procedures by enabling plan members to identify and choose high quality healthcare providers who offer low cost, bundled pricing for a wide range of outpatient surgical procedures.  The Company can help plan members identify physicians who offer all-inclusive, low-cost bundled prices for more than 300 outpatient surgical procedures.  However, the greatest savings are expected to come from approximately 28 commonly performed high cost surgical procedures which PriceMDs refers to as Value Care procedures.   The Company has built a network of more than 400 outpatient surgical centers with more than 1.1 million physicians located in more than 40 states across the country. More than 100 million Americans are currently enrolled in self-insured healthcare plans offered by their employers.  Nearly all such plans are managed by Third Party Administrators (TPAs) who are the primary target market for PriceMDs’ Enterprise Healthcare Solution platform.  PriceMDs charges its TPA customers a $1.00 ‘per member per month’ (“pmpm”) fee without any integration or other up-front fees.  The TPAs and the healthcare plans which they manage are expected to realize healthcare cost savings which are significantly greater than the pmpm fees charged by PriceMDs.  At the same time, plan members also benefit by reducing their own out-of-pocket portion of the cost of the surgical procedure.  For healthcare plans with high deductibles, these cost savings to the plan member can be very significant.  Lastly, physicians are attracted to join PriceMDs network because it does not charge any up-front or annual recurring membership fees.  Rather physicians pay a ‘click through’ fee when plan members make appointments with them.  Such ‘click through’ fees are typically less than 5% of the cost of the procedure and represent a very low customer acquisition cost to the provider. PriceMDs has entered into a strategic marketing agreement with HealthExpense Inc., an established healthcare insurance technology company with more than 35 TPA or other enterprise customers and relationships with more than 360 insurance carriers.  Under the terms of this agreement, HealthExpense is expected to begin to market PriceMDs’ Enterprise Healthcare Solution platform to its customers in the coming months.  In addition, PriceMDs is currently discussing a similar co-marketing partnership with MedImpact Healthcare Systems Inc., one of the largest pharmacy benefits management companies in the U.S. with more than 50 million plan members.  The Company is also in contract discussions with three potential TPA customers and has received verbal commitments from six other potential customers.   PriceMDs has also spoken with more than 100 other TPAs or other potential customers who have expressed interest in the Company’s Enterprise Healthcare Solutions platform."

Also, they provide tools to keep track of changes and versioning, advertising that no data is ever lost, and that you can always see what recently happened (they have a visual diff feature to view changes). The product also contains collaborative tools for content writers to work together on content. On top of the writing-room (content management back-office) and API, a prismic.io content repository comes with an API browser to help developers design their queries (there's one available to see here: https://lesbonneschoses.prismic.io/api), and the team built open-source development kits and blank starter kits, as well as examples, in most major technologies, and are releasing new ones from time to time.

The workplace landscape is changing. By 2020, 50% of the Global workforce will work remotely and there is an anticipated 48% increase in business-travel to medium and high-risk locations. This has made the monitoring and management of employee safety an incredibly challenging endeavor as the traditional workplace is no longer one contained environment.   This changing landscape increases the exposure of employees to hazardous health situations, natural disasters, crime and terror-related threats. As a result, this elevated risk level heightens the corporate liability, legal and moral duty of care that a business has for its ever-moving workforce.  This new reality of elevated risks within the corporate space has led to a shift in the approach towards risk management, where a formalized strategic-company-wide travel management solution is more likely to be adopted. Current travel-risk-management strategies are inept to effectively manage the ever-increasing rise in travelling and remote workers as they are handled manually and coordinated across disparate systems, spreadsheets and email. In any given moment, most companies would have no idea how to accurately locate individual employees in an event of an emergency. Reversely, most employees have no idea who to  contact when they find themselves in dangerous situations.  The consequences of operational failures due to inept and restrictive systems can range from minor inconveniences to major catastrophes, adversely affecting multi-facets of an organization: harm or death to employees, poor brand reputation, financial ramifications, eroding productivity, impaired organization and legal liability.  Companies need a tool in place that allows for: •	The real-time GPS location all employees who potentially face a safety risk •	Two-way communication during an emergency •	The demonstration of proactive safety mechanisms for the entire workforce  The Solution: My PROtect App addresses this one giant gapping need in the space – the ability to account for any individual employee in real-time with accurate GPS coordinates and creating active lines of communication during high-risk situations.
