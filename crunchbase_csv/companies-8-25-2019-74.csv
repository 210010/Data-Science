OneLogin,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/onelogin,"Big Data, Cloud Security, Enterprise Software, Identity Management, Information Technology, SaaS, Software",OneLogin is a cloud identity and access management solution that enables enterprises to secure all apps for their users on all devices.,"OneLogin is the leader in Unified Access Management, Enabling Organizations to Access the World™. OneLogin makes it simpler and safer for organizations to access the apps and data they need anytime, everywhere. The OneLogin Unified Access Management Platform secures millions of identities for thousands of companies around the globe, spans both cloud and on-prem environments, and unifies all users, devices, and applications to transform enterprises.  OneLogin's cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution allows enterprises of all sizes to secure their cloud and on-premise apps for all users and devices. Pre-integrated with thousands of applications, OneLogin enables IT teams to simply and securely tie the company’s directory infrastructure to its business applications. This gives IT centralized access control and the power to enforce rule-based security policies, enable multi-factor authentication, automate user provisioning, and easily report on identity policy compliance. With OneLogin, enterprises can strengthen security, while eliminating directory integration costs and reduce password trouble ticket load. End users can actively participate in enforcing the identity policy as they benefit from single sign-on access to the thousands of pre-integrated apps for use on their laptops and mobile devices. OneLogin has millions of users at more than 2000 organizations in more than 44 countries, including AAA, Airbnb, Airbus, Carlyle Group, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Citizen, Fastenal, Herman Miller, Keller Williams, Pandora, San Jose Unified School District, Steelcase, Tableau Software, and Uber. Solution highlights: * 100% on-demand * Pre-integrated with 4,000+ apps * Integrates with any web app * Market leading directory integration with LDAP, Active Directory, G Suite, Workday, UltiPro, and Namely * Single sign-on and self-service password administration * Automated user on-boarding and instant off-boarding * Role-based access control * Strong authentication with a mobile one-time password app * Two-factor authentication with OneLogin Protect, Duo, RSA, VASCO, SafeNet, Symantec VIP Access, and Yubico Yubikey * Identity compliance reporting * SAML 1.1/2.0, WS-Federation and OpenID single sign-on * Custom connectors for in-house apps * Open-source SAML toolkits. DIFFERENTIATORS:  Recent OneLogin differentiating firsts demonstrating the company’s “bridge for authentication across cloud, on-premise, and mobile” include: OneLogin Adaptive Authentication: OneLogin Adaptive Authentication uses machine learning to build a risk profile that tracks a user’s movement across networks, devices, browsers, and geographies. This information is used to build a user profile for scoring new login attempts and password resets by risk. Some of the factors included in the scoring are IP reputation, device fingerprinting, and geographic location. At the time of authentication, these factors are scored against the user’s profile and the number of required authentication factors are adjusted accordingly. OneLogin’s multi-factor authentication is seamlessly integrated with OneLogin’s single sign-on portal. It also works with numerous other services through the RADIUS and LDAP interfaces of OneLogin’s cloud directory.  OneLogin Desktop: OneLogin Desktop is endpoint management that enrolls a user's laptop or desktop computer with the OneLogin Cloud Directory, and creates a secure profile on their machine that can only be accessed with the company's OneLogin Cloud Directory credentials. Once the user is in their new secure profile, they can access web- and desktop apps as they please, without entering their credentials again. In other words, once a user logs in to their operating system, they don’t need to login again to access their OneLogin Application Portal and SAML-enabled apps. They only login once. OneLogin Real-Time Active Directory Sync: OneLogin has the industry’s fastest and most secure Active Directory connector. IT administrators can now automate the process of quickly granting and revoking cloud access to the right users at the right time. OneLogin Secure RADIUS: OneLogin’s support for RADIUS-enabled appliances, such as Meraki wireless network devices, delivers safe, flexible, and reliable authentication for Wireless and VPN with nothing to install on-premise — an area where other identity management solutions fall short. OneLogin Virtual LDAP: OneLogin is the only cloud identity management solution that ​supplies ​a virtual LDAP directory service. OneLogin’s Virtual LDAP (VLDAP) service enables organizations to unify multiple corporate directories and protect both on- and off-premise applications and devices. On-premise Web Access Management (WAM): WAM secures access to your custom and commercial web applications by integrating them into the OneLogin Single Sign-on Portal. This enables you to extend access policies, identity provisioning, and automated off-boarding to on-premises applications just as you do with SaaS applications.   ACQUISITIONS: In June 2017, OneLogin acquired Auckland, New Zealand-based ThisData, a developer-focused cloud security company specializing in account takeover detection. The technology has been used to enable OneLogin’s adaptive authentication solution, which uses machine learning to intelligently score the risk of each login attempt, and challenges users making high-risk logins to use an additional authentication factor. In November 2016, OneLogin acquired Sphere Secure Workspace, Inc., a software vendor with next-generation mobile container technology. The Sphere technology will be used to extend OneLogin’s endpoint security from desktops to mobile devices and thereby providing a unified endpoint management solution for enterprises. In June 2016, OneLogin acquired Portadi, a cloud-based password management tool. The acquisition enables OneLogin customers to increase employee productivity by automatically populating their OneLogin portal with apps as they manually sign into them. In December 2015 OneLogin acquired Cafésoft, a provider of on-premise Web Access Management (WAM) software, which allows OneLogin to provide a more comprehensive identity solution for hybrid environments. RECOGNITION:  In July 2017, Gartner Peer Insights ranked OneLogin #1 among Access Management providers. In March 2016, OneLogin was named to the “Fast 50” privately held Internet security, networking, and storage companies by JMP Securities LLC. In January 2016, OneLogin was ranked 28th on Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500™, a ranking of the 500 fastest growing technology, media, telecommunications, life sciences and energy tech companies in North America. In December 2015, OneLogin was named a ""Best Place to Work"" by Glassdoor. OneLogin has also been previously named a ""Top Workplace"" by the Bay Area News Group and the Great Place to Work series. In May 2015, Forrester Research ranked OneLogin as the top vendor in the Forrester Wave for Cloud Identity & Access Management."

OneCoin Update is where you can find the latest news on OneCoin, the fastest growing cryptocurrency in the world. So what exactly is OneCoin and how is it different than Bitcoin? Created through a process called “mining,” the service is based around cryptography. Through mining, each digital coin carries a unique identifier, similar to the serial numbers found on paper bills. However, OneCoin is distinct from paper bills in one, very important way. There is a finite number of coins produced. With paper money issued by government mints, there are more bills produced at various times and in various increments. This means that values can rise and fall due to inflation. This is impossible with OneCoin. Another important distinction OneCoin has from paper money is that the coins are impossible to counterfeit. Like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, OneCoin is not tied to any central bank or governmental body. To this end, the value of each coin is based solely on usability, supply, and demand: the founding principles of economics without any of the politics that have driven paper currencies for most of recorded history. OneCoin has one of the largest currency reserves in the world, at 120 billion units. This means that users are guaranteed security with regards to their digital economic reserves. Users can also be sure that there is security from corrupt merchants, such as organized crime members and criminals from every walk of life. When one joins the OneCoin network, they instantly join the millions of miners who use their digital currency in a fully transparent manner to buy all sorts of goods and services. You can make also payments and transfer money from any country, no matter where you find yourself, and know that there is no potential shady dealings tied to your account or your savings."

OneCharge operations cover the US, Latin America, Europe and CIS countries. OneCharge’s client portfolio includes leading multinational companies. The industrial lithium-ion battery market reaches $ 1.5 billion and is growing rapidly. OneCharge has been an industry pioneer and currently is the market leader in the USA. The company sells large quantities of industrial batteries for warehouse equipment. It successfully collaborates with such market leaders as Hyster-Yale, Crown, and Toyota. It’s been highly recognized by customers, dealers, and manufacturers. Lithium-ion batteries accelerate the development of the conservative forklift market. The companies who use them manage to improve their competitive positioning on the market as the batteries provide higher machinery performance.  While competitors are mainly focusing on R&D activities, OneCharge is commercializing lithium-ion battery technology. OneCharge is able to reach specific market niches via increase of its sales as well as better product adaptation for client needs. The company aim is to create easy and ready-to-use solutions for a wide range of industrial clients. This strategy has allowed the company to enter into American market rapidly. OneCharge acts as ‘change ambassador’ in relation to new technologies implementation. The company is continuously investing in technological development. It has been exploring new chemical compositions for batteries that could reduce the cost of the product, balance, and improve it. New developments are quickly implemented in the production process and are gradually becoming new benchmarks on the market. As the industry leader, OneCharge sets the standards from technical solutions to new professional terminology. OneCharge batteries are available to mass industrial consumers. They are delivered via application of EaaS (energy-as-a-service) concept, which previously had a very limited presence on the market. The batteries are equipped with remote data collection and monitoring systems that enable the computation of the energy produced. As a result, the client pays only for the energy consumed, rather than the cost of the battery (which is comparable to the cost of the forklift truck itself). The company does a lot to ensure that the maintenance of its batteries is as simple as possible. It has developed a special modular component system that allows for repair of the batteries without disassembling them. This approach streamlines service department training in order to accelerate the lithium batteries’ expansion into the market. OneCharge has invested in increasing the voltage used in batteries as well. It enhances significantly the efficient energy use for warehouse equipment. Such industry leaders as Hyster-Yale Group support the company in this initiative and willingly contribute to the promotion of high-voltage batteries on the market."
