OneLogin,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/onelogin,"Big Data, Cloud Security, Enterprise Software, Identity Management, Information Technology, SaaS, Software",OneLogin is a cloud identity and access management solution that enables enterprises to secure all apps for their users on all devices.,"OneLogin is the leader in Unified Access Management, Enabling Organizations to Access the World™. OneLogin makes it simpler and safer for organizations to access the apps and data they need anytime, everywhere. The OneLogin Unified Access Management Platform secures millions of identities for thousands of companies around the globe, spans both cloud and on-prem environments, and unifies all users, devices, and applications to transform enterprises.  OneLogin's cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution allows enterprises of all sizes to secure their cloud and on-premise apps for all users and devices. Pre-integrated with thousands of applications, OneLogin enables IT teams to simply and securely tie the company’s directory infrastructure to its business applications. This gives IT centralized access control and the power to enforce rule-based security policies, enable multi-factor authentication, automate user provisioning, and easily report on identity policy compliance. With OneLogin, enterprises can strengthen security, while eliminating directory integration costs and reduce password trouble ticket load. End users can actively participate in enforcing the identity policy as they benefit from single sign-on access to the thousands of pre-integrated apps for use on their laptops and mobile devices. OneLogin has millions of users at more than 2000 organizations in more than 44 countries, including AAA, Airbnb, Airbus, Carlyle Group, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Citizen, Fastenal, Herman Miller, Keller Williams, Pandora, San Jose Unified School District, Steelcase, Tableau Software, and Uber. Solution highlights: * 100% on-demand * Pre-integrated with 4,000+ apps * Integrates with any web app * Market leading directory integration with LDAP, Active Directory, G Suite, Workday, UltiPro, and Namely * Single sign-on and self-service password administration * Automated user on-boarding and instant off-boarding * Role-based access control * Strong authentication with a mobile one-time password app * Two-factor authentication with OneLogin Protect, Duo, RSA, VASCO, SafeNet, Symantec VIP Access, and Yubico Yubikey * Identity compliance reporting * SAML 1.1/2.0, WS-Federation and OpenID single sign-on * Custom connectors for in-house apps * Open-source SAML toolkits. DIFFERENTIATORS:  Recent OneLogin differentiating firsts demonstrating the company’s “bridge for authentication across cloud, on-premise, and mobile” include: OneLogin Adaptive Authentication: OneLogin Adaptive Authentication uses machine learning to build a risk profile that tracks a user’s movement across networks, devices, browsers, and geographies. This information is used to build a user profile for scoring new login attempts and password resets by risk. Some of the factors included in the scoring are IP reputation, device fingerprinting, and geographic location. At the time of authentication, these factors are scored against the user’s profile and the number of required authentication factors are adjusted accordingly. OneLogin’s multi-factor authentication is seamlessly integrated with OneLogin’s single sign-on portal. It also works with numerous other services through the RADIUS and LDAP interfaces of OneLogin’s cloud directory.  OneLogin Desktop: OneLogin Desktop is endpoint management that enrolls a user's laptop or desktop computer with the OneLogin Cloud Directory, and creates a secure profile on their machine that can only be accessed with the company's OneLogin Cloud Directory credentials. Once the user is in their new secure profile, they can access web- and desktop apps as they please, without entering their credentials again. In other words, once a user logs in to their operating system, they don’t need to login again to access their OneLogin Application Portal and SAML-enabled apps. They only login once. OneLogin Real-Time Active Directory Sync: OneLogin has the industry’s fastest and most secure Active Directory connector. IT administrators can now automate the process of quickly granting and revoking cloud access to the right users at the right time. OneLogin Secure RADIUS: OneLogin’s support for RADIUS-enabled appliances, such as Meraki wireless network devices, delivers safe, flexible, and reliable authentication for Wireless and VPN with nothing to install on-premise — an area where other identity management solutions fall short. OneLogin Virtual LDAP: OneLogin is the only cloud identity management solution that ​supplies ​a virtual LDAP directory service. OneLogin’s Virtual LDAP (VLDAP) service enables organizations to unify multiple corporate directories and protect both on- and off-premise applications and devices. On-premise Web Access Management (WAM): WAM secures access to your custom and commercial web applications by integrating them into the OneLogin Single Sign-on Portal. This enables you to extend access policies, identity provisioning, and automated off-boarding to on-premises applications just as you do with SaaS applications.   ACQUISITIONS: In June 2017, OneLogin acquired Auckland, New Zealand-based ThisData, a developer-focused cloud security company specializing in account takeover detection. The technology has been used to enable OneLogin’s adaptive authentication solution, which uses machine learning to intelligently score the risk of each login attempt, and challenges users making high-risk logins to use an additional authentication factor. In November 2016, OneLogin acquired Sphere Secure Workspace, Inc., a software vendor with next-generation mobile container technology. The Sphere technology will be used to extend OneLogin’s endpoint security from desktops to mobile devices and thereby providing a unified endpoint management solution for enterprises. In June 2016, OneLogin acquired Portadi, a cloud-based password management tool. The acquisition enables OneLogin customers to increase employee productivity by automatically populating their OneLogin portal with apps as they manually sign into them. In December 2015 OneLogin acquired Cafésoft, a provider of on-premise Web Access Management (WAM) software, which allows OneLogin to provide a more comprehensive identity solution for hybrid environments. RECOGNITION:  In July 2017, Gartner Peer Insights ranked OneLogin #1 among Access Management providers. In March 2016, OneLogin was named to the “Fast 50” privately held Internet security, networking, and storage companies by JMP Securities LLC. In January 2016, OneLogin was ranked 28th on Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500™, a ranking of the 500 fastest growing technology, media, telecommunications, life sciences and energy tech companies in North America. In December 2015, OneLogin was named a ""Best Place to Work"" by Glassdoor. OneLogin has also been previously named a ""Top Workplace"" by the Bay Area News Group and the Great Place to Work series. In May 2015, Forrester Research ranked OneLogin as the top vendor in the Forrester Wave for Cloud Identity & Access Management."

With a growing dynamic international team, we relentlessly work to set new benchmarks to the industry by optimizing easy-to-integrate functionality for our partners while at the same time, narrowing the gap that staggers between the physical and online market today. Omise now operates in Thailand, Japan, and Singapore. In Thailand, online stores are still striving to have a proper payment solution because applying and implementing has never been simple and smooth. All of the major PSP’s require cumbersome documentation to apply; monthly commitments, high transaction fees and all take considerable amount of time to gain approval. Additionally, there is no good online API documentation or sandbox to test. Thus, stores drive their business by offline payment methods such as ATMs, Banks or online banking. Once shoppers have made their transactions, they have to send a proof of payment to there store via email or other social network channels. Since there is no payment notification, the store has to check the transaction manually which delays the delivery time and increases the chance of fraud. This fraud may occur by shoppers’ photo shopping their proof of payment. Since a reliable, simple and smooth online payment system has been lacking in Thailand, Omise.co founder, Jun Hasegawa and co-founder Ezra Don Harinsut, recognized the need to bridge the gap between stores and shoppers. Therefore, the Omise team has been developing a payment solution that would be available for everyone to sign up and make online payments simple, easy, smooth and possible. Omise is ideal for both developers and non-developers. Applying for Omise only requires minimal online identification, no minimum monthly commitment and low transaction fees. Stores will be able to accept payments instantly.  In addition, for non-developers, accepting payments via social network will be possible for everyone!

The company is leveraging its DIMERx™ technology to address the problem of visceral hypersensitivity and pancreatitis in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders and the unmet medical needs in the treatment of both peripheral neuropathic and systemic nociceptive pain. The lead candidate ORP-101 is a peripherally acting sodium ion channel blocker (Nav 1.7), mu agonist/kappa antagonist dimer. The molecule does not cross the blood brain barrier and, unlike other opioids that constrict the sphincter of Oddi, ORP-101, when given intravenously in animal studies, has instead been shown to relax the sphincter. The former attribute implies no abuse potential and the latter minimizes the risks of pancreatitis and/or abdominal pain related to sphincter of Oddi constriction. These two attributes, in combination with the well-understood pharmacology of ORP-101, make the molecule a suitable candidate for chronic treatment of conditions associated with visceral and somatic hypersensitivity and hyperalgesia. Therefore we have positioned ORP-101 for two non-overlapping indications: the oral form for colonic hyperalgesia and gastric dysmotility in IBS-D and the parenteral form for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. The potential clinical benefits are backed by compelling data from validated animal models. The company is also developing potent non-opioid and opioid conjugates to treat acute and chronic nociceptive pain. The non-opioid analgesic conjugate is designed to be non-ulcerogenic and liver-safe and, therefore, has the potential to reshape the pain market served by acetaminophen and NSAIDs. Similarly, the opioid conjugate is designed to be orally active and have a lower potential for dependence than currently available opioids. DIMERx™ technology results in conjugates designed to preserve the receptor pharmacology of their individual constituents, but to have therapeutic profiles well suited for different clinical indications. The components of the conjugates have all been previously proven to be safe and effective for other indications and, therefore, the conjugates have reduced developmental risks. The DIMERx™ conjugates are considered to be new molecular entities and have composition of matter intellectual property protection."

Orgenesis employs a molecular and cellular approach directed at converting liver cells into functional insulin-producing cells as a treatment for diabetes. This new therapeutic approach is called Autologous Insulin Producing (AIP) cell transplantation. Beta cell replacement is one of the most promising approaches for treatment of Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM). Currently, pancreas islet transplantation is the only approved cell replacement technology and it's the best available treatment for diabetics. However, it's impractical because of a shortage of donor tissue and rejection rate by the patient' immune system. Orgenesis believes that converting the diabetic patients own tissue to insulin producing cells will overcome the problem of donor shortage. Moreover, since the diabetic patient serves as his/her own donor, there is no risk of transplant rejection. Orgenesis has manifested promising results in in-vitro and in-vivo studies using human liver tissues.
