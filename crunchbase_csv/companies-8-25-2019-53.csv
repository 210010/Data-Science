Kabbage,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kabbage,"Credit, Finance, Financial Services, FinTech, Internet, iOS, Lending","Kabbage offers fast, easy loans for small businesses.","Kabbage is a financial technology and data company pioneering a new, automated way for small businesses to access working capital. The company simplifies the manual application process to one that is 100% online and automated. Businesses can use their business data to submit an application online and receive an answer in minutes instead of waiting weeks and filling out numerous forms like traditional lending methods. Businesses can access ongoing lines of credit up to $250,000. Kabbage leverages business data generated such as revenue, accounting data, business transactions, shipping data, social media and other sources to understand a business’s overall health and calculate credit lines throughout the customer lifecycle. The company began serving online merchants in 2011 and extended its automated lending platform to all small businesses – online and brick-and-mortar – in February 2014. In November 2013, Kabbage expanded its business to mobile with an iOS and Android app that enables users to apply or access their funds from their smartphones. Kabbage used to provide a consumer lending product, Karrot, but it is no longer available. Kabbage expanded the application of its platform in March 2015 by licensing the data and technology platform to power lending for other organizations. The company was named one of Forbes magazine’s Most Promising Companies list for the second year in a row. Kabbage further extended its lending reach in May 2015 with the announcement of the new Kabbage Card, which gives businesses the ability to pay for items at the point of sale with a purchasing card tied to their Kabbage account. Kabbage also collaborated with MasterCard in May 2015 to make Kabbage’s data and technology platform available through MasterCard’s network of acquirers. In August 2015, Kabbage was named the 36th fastest-growing private company in America on the Inc. 500 list. In October 2015, Kabbage completed a Series E funding round of $135 million led by Reverence Capital Partners. Holland’s ING, Spain’s Santander (via InnoVentures, Santander's venture capital arm); and Canada’s Scotiabank also participated in the round.

In June 2016, Kabbage was named to CNBC's annual Disruptor 50 list of the most forward-thinking and ambitious companies that are revolutionizing industries and markets worldwide. Two months later, Kabbage was named to the Inc. 500 list of the country's fastest-growing private companies for the second year in a row In August 2016, Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) upgraded and affirmed ratings on Class A2-2 Certificates issued by Kabbage Funding 2014-1 Resecurization Trust. The certificates were upgraded from BBB+(sf) to A-(sf) based on structural improvements to the transaction’s concentration requirements and the existence of more historical data relating to Kabbage’s collateral. KBRA also affirmed the ratings on the Class B2A Certificates of BB-(sf), Class B2B Certificates of BB-(sf) and Class B2C Certificates of B+(sf), which were initially rated in November 2015. In 2017, the company raised $250 million from Softbank Group Corp., raising its total equity funding to $500 million, making Kabbage one of the most well-funded companies with a female co-founder at the helm. It also secured the largest asset-backed securitizations of small business loans in the online lending industry of $525 million. In November, it diversified its debt-funding sources further with a $200 million revolving credit facility with Credit Suisse, earning investment-grade ratings of ‘A’ and ‘BBB’ by DBRS.

In a world dominated by cookie-cutter clones the evil forces of McFashion spread it’s awful agenda throughout the universe. The masses lived in a dark and bland world of predictability and boredom. The culture had been contaminated and Individual style was nonexistent. This was not to stand in the year of our ‘Loop 2000, a beacon of hope flashed from the Northeast guided by an intrepid entrepreneur and his rebel alliance of culturists who rose to battle the evil forces of McFashion. They set out to create a lifestyle brand...something that was more than just an e-commerce site but also a community of style and a full-fledged media powerhouse! The leader who emerged was Greg Selkoe and his rebel army was to be known throughout the universes as Karmaloop. And with your help as well as that from reinforcements worldwide over the past decade, the rebels have beat back the clones and McFashion’s empire has been crumbling under the weight of individuality ever since! It started, like many revolutions, in the underground. A basement to be more specific - Greg’s parents basement to be exact. While hundreds upon thousands of dot.com ventures began to disintegrate, Karmaloop ignored doubts, attacks and negativity (“The Internet?! Ha! You'll never make money off the Internet!”) after that moving operations to a dilapidated piano factory run by a lunatic landlord... and subsequently chasing out crackheads busting in the office, grinding for low or no money while working other “day jobs,” dealing with floods, theft, and fraudsters, engaging in drinking binges and making numerous trips to New York on the Fung Wah Bus aka “the Chicken Run”. All of it to get the gear you really wanted into your closet and concrete culture into your mind. Yet through it all Karmaloop never lost faith for one good reason...cause you had their back. Against all odds, the rebels weathered the battles and became true dot.com survivors. They have moved a couple times since (more crazy landlords, however) and now employ roughly 130 20 and 30-somethings that run Karmaloop in offices in Boston, NY, and LA. They don’t just work for Karmaloop, they live the culture, and it is with that dedication and loyalty (and of course the best customers in the world) that the site has grown into the cultural force Karmaloop is today. Karmaloop consists of: Karmaloop.com with over 300 clothing brands for Guys and Ladies, Karmaloop Kazbah Karmaloop’s market place for select up and coming brands, Karmaloop contests, Karmaloop blogs, Karmaloop music, Karmaloop Look Books, Karmaloop Rep Program, PLNDR.com a private flash sale site, KarmaloopTV.com, Buyer Wire Klickable Video, and coming later in 2011 Boylston Trading Co. exclusive street fashion and custom collabs, and KARMALOOP TV Multi-Platform the first cable channel for Verge Culture.... Celebrating the convergence of underground fashion, music, art, and entertainment! Without the incredible support from their family, friends and partners Karmaloop simply would not exist. But once again the most important key to Karmaloop’s existence is you, the customers and viewers, that has never doubted, spread the word and showed patience. When there were screw ups you understood and you gave love when things were done well - for this the Karmaloop fam will be eternally grateful! Karmaloop pledges to keep killing shit from now until eternity! If you ever need the CEO, Founder, and Owner Greg Selkoe this is his cell phone # 617-216-1013 and this is his email ges@karmaloop.com. Phone calls from solicitors will not be returned."

Karolinska,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/karolinska,"Biotechnology, Medical, Therapeutics",Karolinska Development is an investment firm focused on identifying medical innovation and supporting the creation and growth of companies.,"Karolinska Development aims to create value for patients, researchers, investors and society by developing innovations from world class science into products that can be sold or out-licensed with high returns. The business model is to: SELECT the most commercially attractive medical innovations; DEVELOP innovations to the stage where the greatest return on investment can be achieved; and COMMERCIALIZE the innovations through the sale of companies or out-licensing of products. Karolinska Development has developed a well-structured selection process to identify the most commercially attractive medical innovations screened by KIAB. Pharmaceutical development is a high-risk enterprise. In most cases, development projects fail because of side effects or insufficient efficacy. Successful selection of innovations is fundamental to Karolinska Development’s business model, which makes the inflow of new projects crucial. One key to success lies in selecting those innovations that can be developed from scientific findings to products and have significant commercial potential. To date, over 1,300 projects have been screened by KIAB. The portfolio companies are often founded together with the innovators and are initially operated as virtual companies with few or no employees. During the first six to twelve months, the companies normally have minimal fixed costs and technological development is outsourced. The innovator, who is often employed at an academic institution, normally participates as a board member and scientific advisor. The CEO of a portfolio company cooperates closely with a representative of Karolinska Development, who in most cases is also a board member of the company. The companies are capitalized to reach their next milestone, usually within a period of six to eighteen months. Development projects are continuously monitored, and those that do not meet their stipulated targets are discontinued. In the first three to four years, a portfolio company’s operating expenses are often limited to a few million Swedish kronor per year, which cover the cost of external studies and the salary of the staff. In subsequent years, Karolinska Development and other investors play an important role recruiting key expertise to the companies Karolinska Development intends to realize value by exiting portfolio companies or through out-licensing of projects. Such transactions (especially out-licensing) are often structured as single upfront payments followed by payments based on predetermined milestones and royalties on sales. Although Karolinska Development has a flexible exit strategy, pharmaceutical products are, for two reasons, preferably exited at Phase II. First a successful Phase II study indicates that the pharmaceutical has an effect on patients, which is an important value-enhancing factor when negotiating out-licensing or sales. Secondly, finalizing product development and undertaking Phase III clinical trials frequently requires very large patient populations. In many cases this requires much greater resources than those available at Karolinska Development but these can be found in established pharmaceutical companies. Several licensing deals were closed in 2011 involving projects with a similar focus and development phase to Karolinska Development's projects."

(KMM), Lincoln, Nebraska and Maryville, Missouri Kawasaki was the first foreign vehicle manufacturer to open a manufacturing plant in the U.S.A.. Several far-sighted Kawasaki executives germinated the idea way back in 1974, and it was simple. If you're selling in America, why not build there too -- save time, save shipping and employ local labor. It worked, and years later firms like Nissan, Toyota, VW and Honda followed Kawasaki's lead. Since personnel are the most important part of any business, KMM strives to make working conditions safe and comfortable. Kawasaki employees, working as a team, insure that the same quality standards are incorporated through all processes. Each worker takes personal responsibility for quality and feels pride in a job well done. The consumer products manufacturing facility in Lincoln, located on 335 acres of land, has grown since its opening in 1974 from the original 286,000 square feet to nearly 1.3 million square feet of manufacturing, office and warehouse space. In 2001, the rail car plant was completed at the Lincoln site, adding 437,000 square feet for light rail car manufacturing. Over 1,000 people work at the Lincoln facilities, making KMM a major employer in the Lincoln area. In 1989 the Maryville Plant was opened for production of general purpose engines. The Maryville facility has grown to over 700,000 square feet on 113.7 acres of land employing over 600 people. KMM Research and Development Centers are located at the Lincoln and Maryville facilities to meet customer demands as quickly as possible. The plant operates on a ""just in time"" supply method which eliminates expensive warehousing and over-ordering of parts. Production methods combine the best of Japanese and American techniques, resulting in the unique Kawasaki Production System, of which we're quite proud. For instance, certain parts and pieces are made on special presses located right on the assembly line. This means no shortages or excess inventory on these items for more efficiency and less cost. In many cases, it also means the worker makes the part he assembles, and thus enjoys a full sense of accomplishment. "

This increased accuracy allows organizations to lower working capital while improving fulfillment levels.

In multiple cases, we're able to reduce a company's forecasting error to a 10th of what it was before. As AI is taking over a lot of the manual work, planners can now focus on developing new strategies to maximize revenue and minimize working capital.   Because AI is able to detect patterns in your internal and external data sets, our implementation approach becomes really low-touch and therefore extremely accelerated: we can set up a tenant in our public or private SaaS environment within a few weeks from start to finish.

While Kairosoft's Western storefronts are limited to the Android and iOS app stores, the company has developed for other platforms in Japan including PC, DoCoMo, and Softbank. Today, they still develop for DoCoMo, Android, and iOS. The recent trend is for a title to be developed for DoCoMo, ported to Japanese Android and iOS, and then translated/ported to English Android and iOS. The Android markplace often gets games before the iOS store, and sometimes gets untranslated games unavailable to iOS purchasers such as Card Change and Meimon poketto gakuin 1. Although the Android store has received more unique games, the iOS versions tend to be cheaper. Additionally, iOS apps allow the user to switch freely between English and Japanese translations, rather than requiring separate purchases as the Android store does. Since early 2016, Kairosoft has ported all their previous and new games into the Unity game engine.
