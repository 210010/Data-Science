Front Steps manages the Austin Resource Center for the Homeless (ARCH) via a contract with the City of Austin. In the early years, they served 50-75 homeless clients a day from a small storefront location in downtown Austin. Today, Front Steps provides day resources to over 600 homeless men and women daily at 7th and Neches and provides emergency overnight shelter to 230 men each night. With support from the City of Austin, Front Steps has transformed the ARCH from a day drop-in center with limited services into a 24/7 social service center providing shelter, showers, basic needs, comprehensive case management / support services, and permanent supportive housing programs.   Nine other homeless service providers are co-located at the ARCH, making many of the area’s homeless resources available under one roof. In addition to shelter services, Front Steps contributes to their community’s goal meeting the permanent supportive housing needs of homeless individuals through the development of three low barrier housing programs.  Through the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, the City of Austin, Travis County and their community partners, Front Steps currently houses 54 individuals in scattered-site apartments.  All three Front Steps programs are based on the ‘Housing First’ model with an integrated harm reduction focus.  Their substance abuse program, Streets of Hope, and the Recuperative Care Program, a respite resource for medically fragile homeless men and women, focus on the health and healthcare needs of Austin’s homeless.  And through the generous in-kind contributions of the community and Front Steps volunteers, homeless men and women have found a resource in Front Steps for blankets, used winter coats, socks, work shoes and an assortment of household goods to launch them forward on their journey away from homelessness."

Fritter lets users order from any restaurant that lists their menu online with the option of getting the food delivered. Users browse items from various menus and pick and choose from them to fit their appetite. Fritter works with restaurants who do not offer a delivery service and pairs them up with a qualified driver in a ""driver-share"" program with other restaurants nearby. Meaning restaurants that cannot afford to take on the hassle of employing and insuring delivery personnel have the ability to grow their business with minimal effort. Users can group order at work, add restaurants to their favorite's list, and order from one or more restaurant on the same bill. Fritter allows the user to have direct contact to the restaurant and delivery drivers in real time via email and text message. Deliveries are tracked via geo-tagging in real time so the user knows where the order is. Fritter was founded in 2010 by Derek Dahl, a techie think tank with a background in engineering. Fritter's headquarters are located in Mooresville, North Carolina, which was ranked as the fastest growing microcosm in the United States (Suburb of a Major City). The idea to develop Fritter came from a need for restaurants to maintain constant contact with members in the community. There was no centralized place for restaurants to directly contact hungry people and lure them in with promotions. It was decided to offer online ordering when a large percentage of locals complained about ordering food from restaurants over the phone, especially when they were busy. Fritter organizes all orders for restaurants to help increase workflow and productivity of their staff. Finally hungry people can be sure that their order is prepared the way they want it. Fritter has released a number of tools that let the restaurants stay in control of their menus.
