With the global population projected to reach nine billion by 2050, agricultural output must increase by 70% in this timeframe. As nations such as the United States pursue agriculture-intensive energy policies, demand and price volatility for agriculture commodities will continue to intensify. Diminishing agricultural resources such as arable land and fresh water will further compound this challenge.In the last twenty years, crop yields have improved from intensive breeding programs, increased planting densities, and biotech traits such as insect resistance and herbicide tolerance. However, blockbuster trait releases in recent years are only having single digit percentage impacts on yield. At a time when step changes are needed in crop productivity, yields are plateauing. One contributing factor to the decline in crop development is that nearly all commercial biotech traits are single-gene approaches to protecting yield. But to realize step changes and avoid a yield plateau, we must innovate beyond single-gene approaches to protecting yield, and realize step wise gains by increasing intrinsic yield. Benson Hill is dedicated to delivering substantial production gains to the agriculture sector by advancing biotech-based traits to increase intrinsic yield."

The company is HQ’d in London with a research facility in Cambridge (UK) and further offices in New York and Belgium. BenevolentAI has active R&D drug programmes from discovery to PhaseIIb in disease areas such as ALS, Parkinson’s, Glioblastoma and Sarcopenia   The company seeks to improve patient’s lives by applying technology designed to lower drug development costs, decrease failure rates and increasing the speed at which medicines are generated.  BenevolentAI’s approach to this is to integrate technology across the entire medicinal R&D process (rather than fragments of it) and by doing so solve fundamental innovation roadblocks such as the ability to ingest large data sets, meaningful reasoning on those data sets, validation of ideas from those data sets and the rapid experimentation of those ideas. In order to do this Benevolent AI has created a very large rich bioscience specific knowledge graph which unifies unstructured and structured data.  This is then used by the ‘Benevolent Platform’ - a totally unique end-to-end computational and experimental platform.  The Benevolent Platform ingests data, reads, understands and contextualises data to determine the cause of a disease, proposes a drug target, makes a molecule to treat that disease and then defines the right patients to test that molecule in to drive greater clinical success. This approach enables the company to make infinitely more deductions and inferences across disparate, complex data sources, identifying and creating relationships, trends and patterns, that would be impossible for a human being to make alone.  However, the Benevolent Platform does not not replace the need for scientists but instead augments them – providing access to the full breadth of knowledge and the connections within it, in order to close the gap between data and drugs, evolve ideas and drive superior repeatable science to run disease programmes at scale in a faster more successful way."

Shay, as he’s known in the industry, was the CFO for Millward Brown (a WPP Group company), responsible for Africa, Middle East & Asia Pacific.

He has over 14 years of cross functional work experience in the footwear industry in different areas like manufacturing, product development, range planning, retail buying and merchandising. And he’s worked at major brands like Unilever, Adidas, Puma & Intersport across different countries like India, Switzerland, Germany, UAE, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia & Africa. Before embarking on this venture Abhishek was Buying & Logistics Head for Intersport Middle East. Abhishek also has more than 300 pairs of shoes in his closet! And women thought they were shoe lovers! And last, but in no way the least is VSSK Prasad, co-founder and Director Wholesale & B2B. He smiles a lot, can be very blunt and loves to share a bite with whoever is eating! But when it comes to work, he’s got everything covered. If something has been said, it WILL be done! Prasad is a post graduate in sales and marketing with more than 18 years of experience in wholesale and retail. He has a solid track record of successful rollout, management and turnaround of fortunes through astute planning and execution of various activities in the market place with brands like Adidas, Nike, Fila and MTV.

BehaviorMatrix,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/behaviormatrix,"Analytics, Enterprise Software, Natural Language Processing",BehaviorMatrix is a company that provides products to analyze and interpret emotions.,"BehaviorMatrix is a behavioral analytics firm founded on the principle that human behavior is driven by emotion. This unique approach is built on proprietary technology, which allows BehaviorMatrix℠ to delve deeper in the data mines of human perception and emotion, to deliver actionable data that a brand or company needs to be successful. Being able to find the emotional drivers and track them over time gives BehaviorMatrix the most comprehensive information in the field of behavioral analytics.  Traditional analytics and business performance measures focus on behavior – measuring what people have already done. These systems give brands exceptional visibility into consumer actions like purchasing, voting, endorsements and complaints, but very little insight into the motivation behind those actions. Emotions, on the other hand, are a precursor for behavior. By measuring them, you can predict what people will do in the future. By understanding the emotional drivers behind behavior, brands can proactively work to change those perceptions in their favor. Until now, measurement of consumer emotion has largely been based on surveys and focus groups. These slow, time-consuming methods attempt to extrapolate the entire population from just a small sample. BehaviorMatrix℠ turns this model on its head, using the entire Internet as a source of “emotional signals”. Unlike other “social listening” and “sentiment analysis” tools, BehaviorMatrix℠ measures much more than just positive and negative sentiment. This new platform measures and analyzes more than 100 different human emotions, from the simple (love, hate, joy), to the sophisticated (trust, apathy, amazement). BehaviorMatrix℠ has been developing the patent-pending technology behind this platform since 2008. This technology pulls in tens of millions of unstructured data points from a diverse set of sources, going far beyond the standard social outlets of Facebook and Twitter. This massive trove of data undergoes advanced linguistic and cognitive behavioral analysis to identify and quantify emotional signals, from nuanced feelings to polarizing outbursts. The result is a true quantitative analysis of something that has previously been considered purely qualitative. Brands get numeric measurements of emotion, along with the ability to analyze the magnitude and directionality of change in the numbers. This gives them the power to incorporate emotional data into their strategic processes. BehaviorMatrix offers three unique products based on its technology: Emotional Indexes℠ – A data feed that extracts and quantifies an individual emotional factor (such as “Joy”, “Trust”, “Fear”, etc.) as it relates to a brand and its competitors. Emotional Indexes are updated daily, allowing a brand to monitor consumer perceptions on a near-real-time basis. EmScape℠ Reports – A customized, high-level analysis of the entire emotional landscape surrounding a brand or product. EmScape℠ Reports also benchmark the brand against an average of the competition. EmPower℠ Reports – A comprehensive, highly detailed analysis of the emotional and competitive landscape surrounding a brand or product. These reports provide a segmented analysis of emotional signals, including demographics of opinion leaders (both promoters and detractors), and a complete comparative analysis of competitive brands and products."

BTU is singularly focused on increasing the number of recent college graduates who leave campus with not just a job but a career. At BTU they provide two things that college students desperately need; a scientific and objective way for them to determine what career they would enjoy and succeed at and a personal guide to help them navigate a process that is completely foreign to them and for which they have almost no training or experience…finding their first real job.     A recent Accenture study found that 61% of college graduates leave campus without a job. And if that wasn’t bad enough, only half of the employed graduates find jobs that even require a college degree. The net result is college graduates have on average over $35,000 in student debt and about 80% have no suitable job to show for it.    The marketplace for college recruiting is simply an unstructured, inefficient mess. Companies are making important hiring decisions on extremely limited and subjective information. The results are predictable. Over 40% of new college hires “wash out” in the first 18 months after beginning their first post college job. Mis-hires cost a company on average $60,000 per college recruiting failure. Many of the remaining placements are ill suited to the job function and company they join due to their desperation to find any job that can help them begin to make a dent in their mountain of debt and limited suitable job options. This lack of early career success is extremely costly both to the college graduate and the companies that hire them."

BeneFix,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/benefix,"Health Insurance, Information Technology, Insurance, InsurTech",An open platform for the world to access benefits.,"In a part of the country where it’s more common to see an Amish buggy than an electric car, BeneFix, an insurTech start-up, is working to change how health insurance brokers manage small group benefits with their simple, speedy, and secure technology.  BeneFix offers health insurance brokers a digital platform that delivers 100% accurate quotes 100 times faster. Based in Lancaster, Pa., BeneFix manages data from thousands of plans  offered by major carriers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, offering quotes in minutes from a simple-to-use online interface reminiscent of Zillow. Less than two years after founder Matt Ranauro first had the idea for the platform, the business had a brick-and-mortar office in Lancaster City, over 1,000 customers, and, most recently, became one of nine central Pennsylvania finalists competing for a $100,000 investment from AOL co-founder Steve Case’s “Rise of the Rest” initiative.  The success is due, Ranauro believes, to three factors.  First, his own passion for the product. Ranauro has co-founded several tech companies, most notably ILL Co., a company that has built apps for HBO and Nickelodeon, analytics platforms for KPMG and products for the Mayo Clinic. With each company, Ranauro needed to find health insurance for himself and his co-founders and employees. “It took about two months just to find out what was available, then get enrolled in those products.” He said. “Which seems crazy, right? In 2017?” The question became: how do we streamline this and make it a better experience for everyone? Ranauro’s previous experience is the second factor that contributes to the success and growth of BeneFix.  The final is the Insurtech industry itself.  With insurance, and health insurance particularly, still lagging behind other industries in terms of using and creating technologies that work, the Insurtech industry, a $4.5 trillion industry, has attracted the attention of venture capitalists and tech entrepreneurs alike. Lancaster (Ranauro’s hometown)  may be Amish country, full of farms, buggies and country roads, but BeneFix is out to prove that it’s also fertile soil for creating a company that will revolutionize the health insurance industries’ outdated model.

Our mission is to make homeownership more affordable for our friends and neighbors by combining our experience in mobile app development, mortgage loan origination, and blockchain automation. Bee Mortgage App is the first eMortgage mobile app powered by VLO, a virtual loan officer, whose decision making/data validation protocol is executed via smart contracts processing on a decentralized blockchain network.  Building on the inherent benefits of blockchain data trust, Bee Mortgage App is the first loan origination ecosystem that targets each lender and consumer pain point co-founders Curtis Wood, NMLS 1308125, and Munir Valiani, NMLS 939488, personally identified working on the front lines with consumers.  Unlike other LOS applications that are not mobile or blockchain centric, Bee Mortgage App is built from the ground up based on two disruptive engineering principles: complete mobile accessibility and blockchain automation.  By transferring key, data driven credit approval processes to loan product specific smart contracts, Bee Mortgage App is able to triple production capacity while maintaining cost thereby lowering the cost to getting a mortgage. (Each loan file still completes an initial automated DU/LP underwriting review to receive an Approve/Eligible score and a final manual underwriting review prior to issuing clear-to-close.) This small transfer of data sourced human processes to blockchain automation is the first step in an overall patent pending loan origination architecture ecosystem that will begin and end the loan life cycle entirely on the blockchain, tokenizing an MBS for hand-off to the secondary market. A true mobile-first application and sure to be a go-to solution for realtors looking for fast pre-approvals for their buyers, VLO allows any consumer to submit an application, shop loan products and receive rate quotes; lock rates, track loan progress and close all in-app, 24/7, even after hours.  This automation and LOS bolt-on integration provides the first complete mobile mortgage experience--unlike other mobile mortgage ""apps"" that only allow consumers to begin it--ending with the realtor dropping of the key to you at your new home. Bootstrapping for a year, the developers will be initiating their first raise soon and are close to releasing a clickable prototype.  MVP release Q4 2019. For a demo visit beemortgageapp.com"
