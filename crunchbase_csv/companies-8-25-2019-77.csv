And if by chance there is any document or reports that you need to verify it again will cost you thousands. And again there are reliability issues. You cannot determine the quality of advice you received. Apart from that you have to pay in advance and then wait for the appointment to be scheduled. Where in PLUNES offer you an opportunity to have your own lawyer and doctor anywhere anytime for free. You can send notices, verify documents or medical reports by just sitting over your sofa.

Moreover, borrowing money for your real estate project is much faster and easier than applying to the bank. We bring together people who want to invest in real estate and people on the other side – those who are looking for money to implement their real estate idea. The idea of PROFITUS developed slowly. When working with real estate buyers and sellers and developing real estate projects, more and more people were asking about the possibility of investing their money in real estate. And we have in mind not necessarily large sums of money. To keep money in banks is not a solution because nowadays banks do not pay interest, and investment in shares, with no specific knowledge of this area, is very risky. Yet, real estate is a tangible thing, it protects your money from inflations – in short, real estate is a solution you were looking for. And one more thing – imagine, your real estate constantly generates additional income. Nothing can be better! However, to be able to buy an apartment or commercial premises, renting them and getting those passive income requires a substantial initial contribution. So, what to do? Here the idea of PROFITUS was born – to unite people and give them the opportunity to invest small amounts of money in real estate, to become partners in real estate projects or to implement their own real estate projects. At present, due to the Monetary Promotion Policy of Central Banks, the market has accumulated a large amount of savings: in banks, socks, unworthy deposits. So it’s no surprise that a person who cares about his future understands that money must works – to generate cash flow for the future. Such person wants to make profitable and secure investments. PROFITUS provides such people with the possibility of investing money in real estate and obtaining additional income. Our platform changes the rules of the real estate market. Real estate is considered one of the safest investments, which is: – Inflation-resistant – Creates additional income – Tangible, it is a physical object! PROFITUS collects money from investors and then funds a real estate project. To be truly secure – the investment is protected by the pledged assets of the project owner. And all this can be done ONLINE! No need to leave your home – what is happening with this word? :) Join us and together we will change the approach to investing in real estate!"
