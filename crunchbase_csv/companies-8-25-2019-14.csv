Cinchy,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cinchy,"Collaboration, Data Integration, Enterprise Software, Financial Services",The Data Collaboration Platform,"Today’s digital information exists in isolation, unable to connect with other data or users in any meaningful way. We believe there’s a better way for people to collaborate, and a better way for data to operate. We believe all of your data should work together, and work with you, in a way that requires absolutely no complicated integrations or additional applications.  We believe in simplifying the way data works, and allowing you to do significantly more in less time. Remember when “collaborating” on a document just meant sending around a copy and adding comments, and how easy it was to end up with multiple out-of-sync versions? Then came the cloud, and you could see someone editing a document in real time. Suddenly you knew what digital collaboration really meant. We believe data should work that way as well. Teams should collaborate in real time, sharing controlled access to original sources. When a change is made, that change should be seen instantly across every platform. Any applications referencing that data should be updated automatically. You should be able to see who made the change, and when. There should be no worries about versioning, and no such thing as outdated data. Data owners can see everyone who has access, and approve or reject every change suggested. And all of it should be easy and intuitive for the end user, simplifying the way you manage your business. We believe in letting data work the way it should—connected, collaborative, and completely under your control. And we believe in helping people work better together than ever before."

Cipla's mission is to be a leading global healthcare company which uses technology and innovation to meet everyday needs of all patients.  Cipla is a global pharmaceutical company which uses cutting edge technology and innovation to meet the everyday needs of all patients. For over 80 years, Cipla has emerged as one of the most respected pharmaceutical names in India as well as across more than 100 countries. Cipla's portfolio includes over 1500 products across wide range of therapeutic categories with one quality standard globally.  Whilst delivering a long-term sustainable business, Cipla recognises its duty to provide affordable medicines. Cipla’s emphasis on access for patients was recognised globally for the pioneering role played in HIV/AIDS treatment as the first pharmaceutical company to provide a triple combination anti-retroviral (ARV) in Africa at less than a dollar a day and thereby treating many millions of patients since 2001.  Cipla's research and development focuses on developing innovative products and drug delivery systems. Cipla does not sell its products online and no guidelines for online sales are applicable.  Cipla was born out of Dr. K.A. Hamied’s vision to harness Indian expertise for self-sufficiency in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry in India. Dr. K.A. Hamied was an exemplary visionary who donned various hats; he was a chemist, an entrepreneur and pioneer, an active participant in India’s independence struggle, a close ally of Mahatma Gandhi, Dr. Zakir Hussain and various others, a legislator in the Bombay Presidency, head of various associations, Sheriff of Bombay, proactive supporter and sponsor of institutes of scientific excellence in India.  Be it the commencement of bulk drug production in India, the landmark Indian Patents Act of 1970, the several ‘firsts’ in India and the world, its historic international stance on the price and availability of antiretroviral drugs for HIV treatment in 2000-2001, its free-of-cost Palliative Care Centre for terminally-ill cancer patients, Cipla, under the leadership of its current Chairman Dr. Y.K. Hamied, has stood for fearlessness and compassion. It is not for nothing that we say ‘None Shall be Denied’.  Apart from its various national and international milestones, the story of Cipla’s growth and expansion, its ups and downs, successes and challenges is also one that deserves to be chronicled. According to Dr Y K Hamied, Cipla was ranked 56 in the 1960s.  It is with this view that the Cipla Archives project has been launched recently. We treat our proud legacy with the seriousness and the sense of responsibility it deserves. Cipla wants to share their story, celebrate its rich history, remind themselves of the lessons learned and reflect on the evolution of the pharmaceutical industry in India and at Cipla’s role in shaping it.  The Cipla Archives will bring together and house a treasure-trove of documents, photographs and oral history interviews, among other material. As the project progresses, we hope to make information available through this website. With this initiative and related activities, Cipla not only hope to showcase Cipla’s history but also contribute to the development of business archives in India and serve as a forum for debates and discussions on the history and historiography of science and the pharmaceutical industry in India."

The Creately platform is to design what Spell Check is to Word. Imagine using Word without spell check. Thats what people are going through when they do design today. We automate this time consuming manual accuracy checks & calculations with self validating intelligent knowledge objects that understand how to fit into a model. The backbone of the Creately platform is based on the Knowledge Object (KObject) technology. A KObject is a component that can be used as a building block in a model. KObjects that apply to various scenarios in diverse industries can be created by anyone and users can leverage an online marketplace that allows teams across the world to sell their intelligent KObjects.

By redefining space debris and treating it as the optimal near-term resource for in-space metal production, the company will open the market for space-sourced structural materials. To achieve this vision, the company is developing a group of orbital platforms called Space Foundries that will recycle space debris and non-functioning spacecraft to produce refined metal and salvaged components, massively impacting two areas:  (1) By making space debris valuable, active debris removal becomes a potentially profitable activity,  and space debris remediation/mitigation becomes economically self-sustainable.  (2) The adoption of in-space manufacturing will be accelerated by creating a cost-effective, steady supply of refined metal, well before the commercial availability of lunar or asteroid sourced materials. Although space debris is a significant potential resource, it is only the jumping off point in the company’s long-term vision. Processing space debris allows CisLunar Industries to master in-space materials production early in the development of the cislunar economy and positions the company to be the refinery of choice for future lunar and asteroid miners."

Having lived in the city for three years as NYU students, Susie Levitt and Katie Shea were oh-so-familiar with the pain caused by pointy pumps and strappy stilettos. Their love/hate relationship with these fashion icons wasn’t helped by the fact that these petite powerhouses both stand no taller than 5’2”. Despite their suffering, they simply were unwilling to (totally) give up on these beloved wardrobe staples. And yet, corporate internships, subway dashes, dinner dates, the NYC social scene… all of the above led to too many moments of hobbling, near tears, back to their Union Square apartments. The front door never seemed to come soon enough. One too many encounters with shoeless socialites and barefooted babes led to their AH HA moment... CitySlips was born. These entrepreneurial sole-sisters came up with a concept and design that allowed women to carry back-up ballet flats comfortably, compactly, and conveniently. Juggling classroom term papers and corporate term sheets throughout their senior year of college, Susie and Katie enlisted the opinions of friends, the help of NYU professors, and the time of many NYC professionals and mentors. Nine months later (their baby, literally!), they now have a product that is funk-tional, fashionable and affordable! They’re confident that all of you well-heeded women on-the-go will enjoy these fabulous sole savers."

Which products is a particular component deployed on? Which supplier has a particular component in stock and is the cheapest? Is there a second source available for a specific component? What is the difference between two bill of materials? What is the historical pricing and availability of a component? Who changed that, when did they change it, and what did they change? Having instant access to information such as lifecycle status, potential alternatives, real-time and historical pricing and availability, “where used”, and “who, when and what changed” can help design engineers and procurement personnel make better decisions throughout the product lifecycle, from initial component selection in a design, to understanding the impact of an obsolescence notification.

Changes to a BOM can happen at various stages throughout the lifecycle of a product, often without changing original hardware design data, such as schematics or layout. For many companies, this can involve an error prone manual change to a spreadsheet or document, with no record of who made the changes, when they were made or why they were made. Ciiva provides a fully traceable, version controlled BOM management feature, where every component used in a BOM is linked to an access controlled, centralized component library."

All the curious peeking toms spying around the web to find some wrong doers can take a breath of relief, this isn’t one of those articles. Talking about legal and authentic part-time jobs here!   While in various countries around the globe, students take up part-time jobs to make some money, as waiters, cashiers, petrol pump attendants and many others; in India taking up those jobs is seen as stooping low. With the absence of the idea of Dignity of labour in our outlook, no students do such jobs and depend on their parents and guardians for their pocket money. Though this situation is gradually changing as internet and computers became a part of our day-to-day lives. Everyone looking for making some money legally by doing some freelancing jobs, their opportunities are just a few clicks away.   It is a well-known fact that few freelancing assignments can be found on few freelancing portals for designers, translators and developers. But the students without such talents or expertise find it difficult to find such jobs. These students can try applying tutoring jobs online. Students can always try taking up some tutoring jobs on the subjects that they have a good foundation on or they personally like.  In India, no matter which part, everyone appreciates having access to quality education. Students pursuing a certain course, say commerce can try taking up some part-time tutoring job in order to help school going students with their course. Or the engineering students can be math and science tutors for students taking up pre-degree courses. These jobs not just help students in making a Quick buck, they also help them to have a stronger foundation in their basics. As it is always said, an individual learns more while teaching somebody else. There are various websites like https://www.cityhometution.com/TutorSignUp that are looking for tutors in every field, level and sphere of education be it Commerce, Science, Languages, Computers, Engineering or Medical; not just at the basic or entry level (school level) but also for the students pursuing their graduation level. In short, everyone around is looking for a little help they could find. All that the interested students or the potential tutors need to do is, to sign up with a certain website, create a profile and upload their resume with the subjects they are good at.  Now a Frequently asked question regarding this situation is, how to manage time so that the part-time job doesn’t affect the regular schedule? Answer to that is, the candidates can specify the time of their convenience in their profile along with the distance in a certain city they might be willing to travel to take up this tutoring job. The ones who find the mentioned time accommodating to them contact the candidates or potential tutors regarding the course of action. Students looking for a little help with their course and in search of some home tutorsin the subjects or courses they find difficult can find tutors with expertise in that field or subject in their city, close to their residence.
