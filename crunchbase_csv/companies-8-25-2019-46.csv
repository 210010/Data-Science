Founded in 2009, ipadio began delivering live broadcasts from any kind of telephone including mobile, fixed line and satellite phones. Since then, ipadio has developed a number of services based on its core technology including their flagship ContactEngine for customer interactions, FieldTalk for workforce engagement, and HDMobileVideo for next generation video sharing. As well as millions of users around the globe, ipadio works with multinational corporations, UK Government departments and worldwide charities.  Ipadio technology is used in a broad range of industry sectors including: telecommunications, engineering, education, gaming, healthcare, household services, media, pharmaceutical, retail, sport and transport. Technology: ipadio has combined the power of the Internet with the flexibility and reach of the telephony network.  The consequent cloud-hosted communications servers allow for the easy collection and distribution of any kind of digital content, be that audio, video, image or text.  ipadio makes its technology available to corporates via Software as a Service.   ipadio also makes its audio and video broadcasting services available to users around the globe via either smartphone / tablet apps, via standard telephony, or via satellite telephony. Software as a Service:  ContactEngine: ipadio’s flagship service, ContactEngine is for large-scale daily customer communications.   ContactEngine uses a combination of the following ipadio services to achieve up to 100% customer contact; InteractiveTxt – like internet chat, but via text message.  It’s an easy light touch way to have a brief but detailed conversation with a customer.  The messages are automatically personalised, with each message dependent on the response to the previous one.  Customers can easily respond even when they’re at work or travelling.  VoiceForms – a form you fill in, by voice.  It’s a bit like IVR, but less annoying, since the questions are pre-set to the individual, who are taken on their own personal route with no irritating menus to select from.   Apps – the latest addition to the customer service arsenal, ipadio consider it just another communications channel: alerts from your company pop up on customer’s tablets or smartphones just as they do from LinkedIn or Facebook.   Email – you’ll be familiar with that! ContactEngine is configurable to switch between the channels depending on the urgency of the contact requirement, the time of day, and any other business rules that need applying.  ContactEngine deals with wrong numbers and multiple phone numbers, duplicates and multi-day calling schedules, and a host of other complex daily communication challenges.  And of course there’s an online admin and email or text alerting for the admin staff and management. FieldTalk: One of our most popular services for Internal Communicators, it provides easy 2-way communication between multiple-layers of management & staff without interrupting work schedules. EBrief: It’s like web conferencing, but without the high cost, hassle, or internet bandwidth requirements, so it’s ideal for mass engagement with customers, between staff and executives, or for monthly team updates.  A great way to engage thousands of people simultaneously. HDMobileVideo: ipadio’s Apple and Android apps gather and distribute every sort of content (video, audio, phone, text, images) securely and on-brand. History: ipadio’s core broadcasting technology was first used on November 1st 2008 via satellite phone from the mid-Atlantic, during the Transat Classique Lagasse race on a yacht called Infanta.  The name ipadio comes from Internet Protocol Radio – though the technology has come rather a long way since.  2009: iphone app used globally for broadcasting audio, for example from the World Transplant Games on the Gold Coast of Australia.

Not everyone in India likes to shop online using their credit card. What’s more, a major chunk of the population does not even own a credit card. The fact is that 95 percent of all transactions are cash, which is a significant challenge for E Merchants. There are only 18 million active credit cards in circulation, held by an estimated 8 million people. While there are many more debit cards in circulation, credit cards account for twice the value of transactions at Rs 75,500 Crore vs Rs 38,700 Crore via debit cards. But even with other options for payment gateways, some 30 percent of the purchases are abandoned at the payment stage. Today, Indian E Commerce serves 60% of their orders via Cash-on-Delivery options. Unfortunately, an estimated 4% of the revenue goes towards solving the problems that arise out of the Cash On Delivery model.

We believe there is more to come. A lot more. People are no longer impressed by traditional advertising, because they have learned, the hard way, that a commercial (by the company selling the product or service) is about as believable as a career politician's campaign promises. We don't buy it anymore, not when we are sold SUPERB in the media, yet receive BARELY ADEQUATE for our money. ippio.com was born out of this state of market disrepair, of consumer complacency. There are many people who review products on YouTube. But these reviews are both lost in the haze that is YouTube, and not leveraged to affect real change. ippio.com is a place for unbiased consumers to post video reviews of products and services they have spent money on. It is both a resource for consumers, a first line of defense against poor quality in the marketplace, as well as a way that we, the people, can put pressure on companies and brands to deliver better quality. Isn't it remarkable that virtually no one in America is crying out about the fact that we are one of the only countries in the world that pays for incoming calls? And on unreliable networks that charge virtually double what the average European pays! Consumers are starting to trust only other consumers. That trend will become as intrenched in the marketplace as fictional, acted advertising has been for the last several decades. The video review is the tool of this user-generated movement. And so it is the consumer video review that stars, that fills the spotlight, on the stage that is www.ippio.com. We believe that people will connect with what we are doing, as they have already begun to do. www.ippio.com :: review your world"
