NociMed,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nocimed,"Medical, Medical Device, SaaS, Therapeutics",Nocimed is a Google Chrome browser cloud/SaaS app to image pain by measuring chemical pain biomarkers using existing MR spectroscopy.,"Nocimed is located in San Mateo, CA and was founded in 2008 by Jim Peacock (CEO), Dr. Jeff Lotz, Dr. David Bradford, and Emerge-Nocimed, LLC (medical device incubator) to commercially develop disruptive new pain imaging technologies co-invented by Drs. Lotz and Bradford at, and exclusively licensed from, UC San Francisco. The extensive experience and cross-functional backgrounds of these co-founders merge for the second time with Nocimed, which follows another disruptive new spine therapy company also previously co-founded and successfully launched under their combined leadership. This same consortium provides the foundation for Nocimed's on-going direction and execution, which has already successfully achieved many significant milestones.  The company has conducted its operations since early 2008 on over $3.5 million dollars of Series A Preferred financing.  This was raised via private placement “Angel” investments via accredited investors, including from each of the company’s founders and a long list of world renowned thought leaders in spine surgery, pain management, and imaging/radiology.  The company's direction and management continue to be led by its co-founders, and via an expanded team of management and operational professionals - and other consultants - adding further significant experience and acumen in engineering, sales & marketing, reimbursement, and regulatory/quality/clinical affairs relevant to the company's field.  The company already achieved many significant development milestones for its primary first investigational product, NociscanTM, involving multiple inventions captured in intellectual property owned by the Company. The company initially sponsored a $1MM/2 year co-development program at UCSF from early 2008 to early 2010.  This principally featured feasibility clinical studies to initially develop the technology for use with one initial commercially available high field MR system for robustly acquired and post-processed in vivo MRS data, and to train a diagnostic algorithm based on that MRS data which correlates highly to pain and degeneration per other standard diagnostic controls (e.g. including invasive discogram for pain).  The data from this initial investigational clinical development study demonstrated high procedural success for the Nociscan MRS diagnostic platform, with extremely high diagnostic accuracy against standard controls for diagnosing discs as painful vs. non-painful, and was the subject of multiple podium presentations in various medical and scientific society venues.  Nocimed's more recent activities and objectives have been to advance Nociscan in next investigational development steps from the successful initial development and feasibility experience enjoyed at UC San Francisco.  This has principally involved development for cross-platform use via multiple different MR system platforms from different manufacturers, and while gathering more clinical data for assessing correlations and algorithm training.  The company plans to complete this development under an on-going multi-platform, multi-center study that was IRB approved in October 2011 and launched on a first platform (Siemens 3T Verio) in November 2011.  While Nociscan is being developed and evaluated for compatible use with various MR systems from multiple manufacturers, the company is using the current study and conducting concurrent negotiations to evaluate which MR system(s) will be chosen for advancement for future trials, regulatory pathways, and ultimate planned commercialization in the future.  Upon successful completion of this study, the company plans to freeze the platform design for a first generation planned product offering, and conduct a prospective, multi-center trial to further confirm the robustness of the uses intended for regulatory clearance of the platform.  These latter activities are likely to be conducted via a multi-$ million dollar Series B Preferred financing that the company plans to conduct by mid-2011."

Notesgen effectively supplements classroom teaching and professional coaching by giving access to notes of other students with similar backgrounds and help them learn concepts as the students themselves understand. The hand-written authenticity and contextual relevance of the notes on Notesgen makes it a highly engaging and value-added resource.  And for personalization, the notes feed mechanism used by Notesgen shows the student only those notes that they have shown interest in, saving precious study time. NotesGen also makes notes social.

The invoice finance industry has been around for a long time and has rightly gained a reputation for predatory legal and commercial practices. Since they started NoviCap, it has become clear to us that traditional invoice finance firms make their product sound needlessly complex in order to charge higher rates and confusing fees. The root cause for this widespread industry behaviour is systemic as factoring firms have a lot of overhead costs. They do not leverage technology to offer online services and rely on expensive field sales to gain clients. Many are so low-tech that they run their business entirely on excel spreadsheets. The few firms that use software are using expensive legacy systems. This inefficient cost structure causes traditional firms to overcharge their customers and to save money in customer service. This is why in 2014 they started NoviCap and have built their technology from the ground up with the customer in mind. The end result is an invoice finance facility where every step is easy, fast and transparent. You can experience this difference with their instant pricing, fast onboarding, rapid turnaround, simple fee structure and ultimately much lower rates. Since their technology eliminated so much inefficiencies it has become truly easy to use. They are able to give customers a simple 'push for cash' button in their existing invoicing software."

The visionary behind this product, Lael A. Alexander, has a knack for building upon ideas to continually improve on what others might deem perfection.

Currently, the company is focused on the launch of its developed line of products including the Noitavonne:tm: A357 series of Android smartphones; The Noitavonne:tm: Loop tablet which comes in two sizes (7” & 10”) and the company’s premier tablet, The Noit:tm: Embrace which won “Best In Show” at the CTIA Wireless Technology conference. All products are set to debut 2012-2013. In an ever changing environment, the last forty years has led to a rapid pace of technological advancement leaving consumers to shed personal computers for tablets, landline phones to smartphones and physical storage units to the “cloud”.

Our internationally patented products such as the iconic N200 solar light bulb and our newly-released RayCel solar phone charger improve security, enable education, and improve income generation. Nokero partners with distributors that sell products to the 1.3B people living without electricity. Distribtors include, for example, commerical partners (e.g. Eureka Forbes with 10,000 door-to-door salesmen in India, and The Hot Bread Bakery of 30 stores in Fiji) and focused non-profits pursuing market-based solutions (e.g. Earthspark International in Haiti, Solar Sister in Uganda, and ShelterBox worldwide). Solar products reduce rural poverty. Nokero`s distributors earn healthy margins and access to dealer tool kits such as sales tool kits. For the end users (our distributor`s customers) our products save them tremendous amounts of money. Example, in a study with the Government of Mexico, un-electrified households who replaced their candles with a Nokero solar bulb saved an average of $0.80 per day. The breakeven was 12 days at full retail prices. Removing daily lighting costs makes funds available for life-improving activities (e.g. education, form investment, etc.)"

Yes, in the world as I would have it, there would be pizza for breakfast, pizza for lunch and pizza for dinner.  Pizza for that late-night snack, too! In my view, the only acceptable pizza substitute might be a good sub.  Not the get-it-on-every-corner sub where you happen to get a little meat and cheese with your mouthful of bread, but mouth-watering, whole-muscle meats and fresh veggies that happen to be blanketed with delicious, fresh bread – that kind of sub.  Yes, I might possibly allow a good sub to sub for pizza! Now when we at Noble Roman’s think about pizza, which we tend to do all day every day, we not only think about making pizza good, we think about making pizza a convenience.  That’s why we make our delicious pizza available in convenience stores – convenience stores are convenient.  Good convenience store owners take care of their customers and serve delicious Noble Roman’s pizza as a convenience to you.  We make our pizza available in bowling centers, too, because everyone wants to eat pizza when they bowl.  And not just when you are bowling, but when you are working, hanging out at college, travelling through the airport, going to the zoo, visiting a friend at the hospital, enjoying a day at the amusement park - - well, you get the idea, we try to make our pizza available wherever you happen to be.

(Novelix), is a private, La Jolla based, biotechnology company committed to developing innovative, proprietary, dermatology products with large market potential to treat serious skin diseases. The company's main focus is the development of NVX-207, a novel, topical drug candidate with the potential to revolutionize how actinic keratosis (AK) is being treated in the absence of inflammation. AK is a pre-cancerous skin condition resulting from prolonged sun exposure and is one of the the skin diseases most frequently diagnosed by US dermatologists, affecting more than 60 million Americans. In Australia, for instance, AK affects about half the population over age 50. While the overall AK market is estimated at over $2 billion in the US alone, topical therapy is used in only about 25% of patients due to limited activity (complete clearance of lesions in only about half the patients) and often severe side effects of available topical products. In spite of these deficiencies, the AK market for topical products in the US alone exceeded $450 million in 2009 growing at 22% per annum. NVX-207's patent position is strong, development timelines to human proof of concept in AK patients are short and interest in the opportunity at the proof of concept level is clear. A recent transaction demonstrates the interest in new therapies in AK markets - LEO Pharma of Denmark acquired Peplin for $287.5 million in cash to gain access to PEP005, a natural product, without composition of matter patent protection and average to low activity, in late stage development for AK.

When budgets are flat across many industries, It's no wonder that customers are aggressively considering Software Defined Storage (SDS) as a way to meet business needs. But many have learned that there's no free lunch, and although SDS provided up-front cost-savings, there's been little or no relief when it comes to the hidden costs of storage: long POCs, planful deployments, lengthy tuning processes, restrictive networking, forklift upgrades, and long learning curves.  It's no wonder the industry has coined the new term ""SDS-hangover"".   Public cloud storage is attractive for obvious reasons. They're instant-on, elastic up (and down!), there's no infrastructure management overhead, and they're pay-as-you-go. But there are hidden costs of public cloud; WAN performance penalties, governance risk, and non-deterministic billing with hidden costs. Can’t they have the benefits of cloud without sacrificing security, control, and Opex consistency? Noobaa's solution delivers the low-TCO attributes of public-cloud storage in a locally managed solution. NooBaa’s unique architecture dramatically reduces capex, opex, setup headaches, and lifecycle costs compared to existing file storage. Whereas existing NAS and object systems require extensive administration and monolithic infrastructure deployments, the Noobaa storage service is designed for minimal intervention, can be invoked in minutes, and can scale seamlessly over time into the multi-Petabyte range, using any compute resources available to the enterprise."
