The items available for purchase were created with craftsmanship and artisanship, qualities that have been sacrificed in a world of cheap prices and fast production.  Just as Whole Foods sparked a movement based on the belief that consumers should question where food comes from, Zady is creating a new vision for shopping and is at the forefront of conscious consumerism, which demands transparency for sourced products. Manufacturing transparency is at the heart of Zady; every item sold is from a designer who is conscious of where and how their products are made. Each product is personally vetted by Zady’s founders, using criteria for sustainability, including whether the product is locally-sourced, handmade, uses high-quality raw materials, is environmentally-conscious, or made in the U.S.A. The brands are required to sign a contract verifying the location of the company, the manufacturing city, and the source of the raw materials. However, consumers won’t need to compromise style for a clear conscience. All products sold on Zady are high-quality, timeless in style, and are build to last, withstanding fleeting seasonal trends and the short life-spans of poorly-made “fast fashion” items.  As such, Zady will be the arbiter of authenticity-meets-taste for this generation of conscious consumers."

Founded in 2009 by entrepreneurs with experience in the grocery industry, the Company’s mission is to bring high-quality, farm-fresh food direct to consumers at wholesale prices. Rather than work through distributors, warehouses and grocery store channels, Zaycon fills its trucks with food sourced from the farm based on pre-order demand and delivers the food directly to the customer, thus preserving freshness, taste and nutrition. Zaycon’s customers pre-order their food choices online and then pick up their orders at pre-determined local locations (often large and centrally-located parking lots). Furthermore, by removing the middlemen, Zaycon is able to offer the lowest prices, providing customers with savings of up to 50% compared to prices at traditional grocery stores. In addition, Zaycon’s proprietary business model requires no fixed assets, no warehousing and zero waste all while collecting up-front customer payments prior to delivery. The Company currently offers a wide range of fresh foods including poultry, beef, pork, seafood and fresh fruit and delivers to more than 1,200 locations – through ~7,000 sales events – across 48 states.

Her nutritional needs, culinary expertise and love for a challenge inspired the launch of the business and the creation of each product. As my kids were growing up, they noticed certain foods were causing among other discomforts, stomach aches, ear infections, rashes and lethargy. Some reactions were much more obvious than others which complicated the discovery of the food allergies. One of the greatest comforts of motherhood is having healthy, happy children. While cooking raw, vegan and gluten free food takes planning and time, it is worth the effort to see my children energetic and happy after each meal. Once they identified and eliminated gluten, soy, and dairy, my kids and I needed to figure out how to navigate the daily challenges of a specialized diet. I wanted my kids to be able to go to a friend’s birthday party and share the joy of cupcakes and other desserts. When I discovered that raw food was gluten free, dairy free and amazingly good I began creating kid friendly vegan, raw desserts. I spent a few years challenging myself to create healthier and more interesting raw desserts. In 2011, I started Zaza Raw to make raw, vegan, gluten free, dairy free, and soy free dessert available to others."

All these features come together to provide a comfortable and rewarding living experience right at the heart of New York, without all the trappings of big city living.   This focus on a more family-centric lifestyle is one that the team takes very seriously. A proudly family-owned business for more than 30 years, the company’s approach to its service reflects the very same principles that George Subraj and his close-knit family espouse in their own personal lives. For the Subrajs, service to the community and to the real estate market is intrinsically tied in with each other, and the company’s focus on providing the Queens community with high-quality rental options is reflective of that principle.   Of course, this approach has paid off in a big way for the company as well. Their growth over the years has been nothing short of spectacular, and its constantly expanding portfolio of properties and holdings serve as ample testament to the success of the business formula. In 2012, the company acquired a sizable five-building apartment portfolio in Queens for a cool $39 million, greatly expanding its existing holdings. Purchased from real estate firm Urban American, the properties made an ideal addition to their existing holdings due to their location and design.   In June 2016, they added yet another high value portfolio to its holdings with the purchase of a 6-building, 96-unit residential complex in Jamaica. Purchased for $21.5 million, the properties comprised sizable units all large enough to be expanded into two to three bedroom units. Covering a total area of 42,500 square feet, all 96 units are rent stabilized as well, making them even more attractive prospects for individuals and families looking for cost-effective rental options east of Manhattan."

Zaizher.im,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zaizher-im,"Apps, Internet, Mobile",Zaizher.im is a location-based social communication application.,"Zaizher.im is China's leading mobile, location-based business networking app.  A mix of Who's Here, LinkedIn and BranchOut, Zaizher.im allows users to immediately view professional profiles of those around them and swap digital business cards with people of interest. Login with Sina Weibo (China's Twitter) and Zaizher immediately pulls in your Weibo profile information, including profile photo, tags, introduction, fans, tweets and verification information, filling out your personal business card. When users find someone of interest they can swap business cards and then chat online.  To help users quickly find people of interest Zaizher offers a Filter/Search function and Events section. Through the Filter function users can filter by distance and industry, and will be able to filter by city, tags, titles, companies and other information in the future. In the future Zaizher will analyze user data to provide customized recommendations, allowing users to quickly connect with people they are most interested in. Events provides users with a list of upcoming business events going on around the country. Users can view recommended events and register to attend directly through Zaizher. Once inside users can see who else will be/is/has attending/ed. These are saved permanently so that whenever users want to find someone they can go back and open the event and search for them. Zaizher has also developed a event promotion platform similar to EventBrite but focused on providing event organizers a mobile promotion and interaction platform. This allows event organizers to push invitations directly to their invitees phones through push notification and text message. Attendees can then RSVP/register through text, mobile web, or Zaizher.  This event platform enables Zaizher to bring 100% of attendees into the app, regardless of whether or not they are Zaizher users. Non-Zaizher users are notified by text message when they receive business cards through Zaizher. Zaizher is aiming to become the LinkedIn of China. LinkedIn and LinkedIn like clones have not taken off in China for a two major of reasons: 1 - Chinese do not like sharing their contacts. In a country where guanxi is king, the thought of opening up phonebooks for others to see is against Chinese cultural norms. Common contacts is the basis for trust on LinkedIn without this data it is very difficult for LinkedIn to operate. 2 - Chinese value face-to-face communication over online communication. The average Chinese business person is always on the road, from one meeting to the next, there has very little time to spend in front of a PC. Zaizher's model is uniquely Chinese in two ways: 1- Mobile/location based service allows users to quickly setup face-to-face meetings. When users see other interesting users close by they can immediately setup a time to meet for coffee or lunch. 2- Zaizher relies on open information in existing networks to generate trust between users, similar to how BranchOut users Facebook. 'Friends' collected on Zaizher are completely private.  3- Zaizher's app provides a drastically simplified professional networking experience, that is accessible to the generation of working class that did not grow up with computers (Chinese aged 30+). Zaizher focuses on the most basic aspect, connecting users with other people of interest. Zaizher is currently the leading mobile professional network in China. Launched in Beta on August 20th and has quickly accumulated over 20,000 users without any promotion."

During several years of research, it has developed HOS, a cutting-edge material produced from straw. HOS is entirely ecological and 100% recyclable. It is also light, strong, insulating, durable, and easy to maintain. A crucial advantage of the material, however, is that it readily takes any shape and allows to work in 3D. At the moment, creating three-dimensional objects of high quality is rather complicated and costly; HOS is making it simple, easy, and affordable. Moreover, Zadta Tech has developed special additives that, when mixed into HOS, allow to produce plaster of original colours and shades. These properties enable the material to compete with wood, concrete, and even plastics, and account for its multifunctional usage. Thus, HOS makes nature-friendly 3D design and construction a reality. Moreover, Zadta Tech's technology allows to produce HOS not only out of straw but any other plant-derived natural fibers, be it sugarcane, corn, coconut coir, etc. This helps to meet any wishes and requirements of a client. Besides, the fact that HOS can be produced out of any local raw materials (sugarcane in Africa, corn in Latin America, rice straw in Asia, and so on) enables the manufacturer to optimize the costs. At the moment, there are four HOS-based products that Zadta Tech has launched or is in the process of launching: HOS 3D Plaster, HOS 3D Mass, HOS Decorative Panels, and HOS COLOUR Plaster. Also, Zadta Tech is offering services that involve the creation of customized furniture and 3D elements out of HOS. We are aiming to enlarge the scope of the material's application in the construction sector, with the goal of constructing entire buildings out of HOS in the near future, and other areas."

The company was jointly funded by Hewlett Packard and Draper Fisher Jurvetson with the primary goal of sending a (postal) letter as fast and easy as sending an email message. Zairmail has remained true to its core mission since that time. The company has created a completely automated mailing system for postcards, letters, snap-packs, self-mailers, and other popular formats. Campaigns are launched online in less than 60 seconds: just upload a document, upload a list, approve an online proof, and Zairmail takes it from there. Zairmail routes the direct mail campaign digitally to the optimal production facility based on mail destination and equipment required. The mail is then printed, folded, inserted, addressed, and mailed — all on high-speed commercial production equipment. Zairmail also uses an intelligent mail barcode (IMB) to track mail all the way to the point of final delivery. Based on its long-standing partnership with Microsoft — Zairmail has been a certified Microsoft partner for well over a decade — Zairmail also supports features unique in the industry such as a native Microsoft Word mail-merge."

Consumed by fear of losing everything they own if they miss one loan payment, some of the most vulnerable women have been excluded from the microlending sector despite the fact that microfinance was originally envisioned as a tool to help the most vulnerable. Intimidated by borrowing from traditional microlending institutions, but eager to financially contribute to their families, the women we work with have been eagerly awaiting a lending model that place the quality of life for individuals and communities over the size of portfolios and repayment rates. Zawadisha was created to fill this gap and to offer an alternative lending opportunity for women, one with flexible repayment rates, transparent terms, and training. Women choose to borrow from Zawadisha because we prioritize the development of local leadership to leverage social capital in lieu of collateral. Rather than penalizing poor women for taking risks to create new businesses and invest in their families, we engage them as decision-makers and leaders in the organization, determining their own unique policies and guidelines. We are building and maintaining a flat organization where decisions are made through consensus and everyone’s voice is heard. We believe this non-hierarchical organizational style allows us to remain agile and flexible, giving us the ability to iterate our program designs to fit the most pressing needs of our members, which is currently centered around water, energy, and food security. Our members determine policies that best work for their particular group and lending plans are co-created and individualized to meet the needs of diverse communities, understanding that what may work in urban cities like Nairobi might not work in rural towns like Kilgoris. Our model is building a stronger world, one in which women are self-sufficient, successful, and stand on their own two feet. We believe that this allows us to avoid a potentially harmful “one-size-fits-all” approach that characterizes similar work in the field of women’s economic empowerment."
