The Omni evolves virtual reality one step further, allowing anyone to stand up and traverse virtual worlds with the natural use of their own feet. Moving naturally in virtual reality creates an unprecedented sense of immersion. True virtual reality cannot be experienced sitting down. The panoramic visuals offered by head mounted displays need corresponding natural movement to maintain our sense of orientation and feeling of immersion. The Omni will free gamers from passive, seated gameplay, unleashing the full potential of virtual reality gaming with the Oculus Rift and future head mounted displays. Gaming on a keyboard, mouse or gamepad while seated pales in comparison to the intense experience and fun that comes from actually walking, running, and jumping in games. The Omni is the result of two years of design and testing. The base of the Omni is a grooved, low-friction surface. Special shoes keep the foot stabilized and prevent lateral sliding. Users walk naturally—and the result is a natural interface that works with any game or application that uses keyboard input. Walk, run, jump, or strafe—movements mapped to the keyboard can be mapped to natural motion with the Omni. Applications of natural movement in virtual reality stretch far beyond gaming: training and simulation, fitness, virtual tourism, virtual tradeshows and events, meet-ups and multi-person adventures, virtual workplaces, museums, VR architecture, VR concerts… The possibilities are limitless. The Virtuix Omni is now available for pre-order online. Visit our online store here."

Once the veins lose their ability to convey blood without reflux, the progressive venous disease cycle has begun. This is commonly referred to as chronic venous insufficiency, or CVI. The blood will begin to back up into the peripheral veins, causing venous hypertension, potential thrombosis (clotting), and leading to even more damage of the vein walls and valves.

VideoKen,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/videoken,"Education, Internet, Social",VideoKen is an AI-based platform that makes informational videos rich and consumable.,"About us: Millions of informational videos are available on internet, but are highly underutilized due to the short attention span of people. VideoKen is an AI-based platform that makes informational videos rich and consumable. It uses AI techniques to automatically index videos, creating table-of-contents and phrase cloud, which nicely summarize key topics in a video, and lets viewers jump directly to the topics of interest within a video. It also supports more effective video search (without a reliance on manual tags), lead generation for businesses, and rich insights into video viewing behavior of the target audience. Problem Statement: Videos account for roughly 75% of the internet traffic. Enterprises are using informational videos for employee learning, sales enablement, marketing and internal communication. However, the intended viewers rarely have the time and patience to watch more than a few minutes of these videos. On a related note, although millions of learning videos are freely available, covering practically any topic, it is well known that learners get disengaged very quickly. VideoKen is transforming the way people consume and utilize informational videos, and in the process, also creating value for the organizations creating the video content. Example: Here are some of the sample links that illustrate how hard it is to peer inside and navigate long videos on the popular (and powerful) YouTube platform, and the difference made by AI-based techniques (explained below) in VideoKen. 1.

VocalZoom,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/vocalzoom,"Audio, Biometrics, Sensor, Speech Recognition, Wireless",VocalZoom mission to enable Voice control and Voice Authentication. Multifunction Sensors Enable Human Machine communication.,"Multifunction Sensors Enable New Generation of Human-to-Machine Communication (HMC) Fueling The Speech-Activated Digital Lifestyle:  VocalZoom Enables  More Natural, Personalized and Secure Voice-Control Experience VocalZoom helps solve one of the biggest challenges facing the move beyond keyboards and touchscreens to a significantly improved user experience (UX) for today’s increasingly mobile and interconnected world.  The problem?  While voice control user interface (UI) solutions have been heralded as the next step, they can’t make devices do as they’re asked without exceeding the threshold of user frustration.  They don’t capture human speech in such a way that a person’s voice can be seamlessly, naturally and conveniently used for everything from controlling virtual assistants, wearable devices and car functions to authenticating individuals for such personalized actions as opening locked doors, transacting, and performing other secure tasks.  Today’s solutions need more and better voice data.  The company’s multifunction HMC sensor technology can help.  The Challenge With human-to-human voice interactions, the goal is to optimize how conversation sounds.  In contrast, the key for human-to-machine interactions using virtual assistants and automotive voice control is whether the machine did what it was told to do, quickly and accurately enough to satisfy the user.  Today’s technologies aren’t up to the task.  Voice processing can improve audio’s overall quality (generally to industry-standard profiles that have been deemed most pleasing to the human ear), but has difficulty with transient or loud sounds typical of real life, such as when a person is surrounded by street noise.  And although noise reduction algorithms used with acoustic microphones have improved, today’s microphones can’t be implemented with enough directional acquisition capabilities to isolate one voice from others, especially in noisy environments.   Human-to-machine interactions demand more precisely targeted voice acquisition, at any noise level, than today’s microphones provide, so machines can identify users, understand their commands and correctly respond to and obey the person authorized to give them instructions.  Achieving a critical combination of authenticated and accurate voice control requires going beyond a simple human-to-machine interface (HMI) to the next-generation, higher-order concept of secure human-to-machine communication (HMC).   Solving the Problem The VocalZoom multifunction HMC sensor adds an important new UX layer:  enabling systems to gather critical additional information exclusively about the user who is communicating with a device.  This information is derived from the optical data generated during speech as facial skin (around such areas as the mouth, lip, cheek and throat) vibrates.  By focusing the VocalZoom HMC sensor on these areas, measuring the vibrations, and converting this data to an audio signal, the speaker’s voice can be isolated, giving voice authentication and control platforms a near-perfect reference signal with which to operate – regardless of noise levels. VocalZoom’s solution will become increasingly important to 1) support growing use of wearables, in-car infotainment systems and other applications where voice control delivers the best, most natural (not requiring looking at or touching) UX, and 2) meet the increasingly important need to employ voice as an authentication factor for an expanding range of personalized on-line and mobile financial, healthcare and other secure cloud-based services.  The sensor can also be used to enhance general voice communication and for applications including proximity sensing, vibration measurement and 3D imaging, creating a new category of multifunction HMC sensors for many simultaneous, high-value UX-focused system capabilities.  Compact and power-efficient, the sensor fits into small devices and is available for both head-mounted (virtual and augmented reality glasses, headsets, helmets) and remote (voice-controlled automotive infotainment and self-service kiosks) applications. Applications Better Performing, More Power-Efficient  and Streamlined Headsets and Other Wearables VocalZoom is redefining head-mounted communication devices in applications from aviation headphones to gaming and virtual/augmented reality gear to emergency response communications solutions.  The performance, size and power efficiency of the multifunction HMC sensor enable system designers to “remove the boom” that was previously required in order to position an acoustic mic close to the user’s voice in a challenging noise environment, cutting costs while improving the user experience.  The Most Convenient Form of Access Control The VocalZoom multifunction HMC sensor provides a single solution for adding voice authentication to voice control solutions.  It delivers a near-perfect isolated signal, becoming the eyes and ears of solutions that can both understand and identify users and ensure they are who they claim to be.   Truly “No-Hands” and Distraction-Free Automotive Voice Control Automotive industry experts from J.D. Powers to the AAA Foundation have concluded that “hands-free” does not yet mean risk-free.  VocalZoom solves this problem with a solution that provides seamless, near-perfect performance in noisy environments.  A single VocalZoom multifunction HMC sensor can be installed in the rear-view mirror and used to authenticate the driver, provide clean, driver-isolated voice commands and potentially deliver additional driver-monitoring capabilities to improve user safety and convenience."

Mission Statement: To provide our customers with a safe, secure, and universal drone receptacles. To provide our customers with the convenience of secured automated home delivery. To ensure our commitment to quality is apparent in everything we do.   Company Description Drone delivery is the future of last mile logistics. Drone delivery will heavily reduce shipping costs, minimize pollution, decrease road congestion and significantly increase customer convenience. To reach a meaningful scale, drones need a standardized, safe, and secure place to land. Valqari’s solution is the Smart Drone Delivery Mailbox, or commonly referred to as a RCVR-PAD (Remote Communicating Vault Receiver - Personal Automated Delivery). Valqari’s patented RCVR-PAD serves as a designated area for drones to safely land, protecting people, pets, and property from being harmed. The RCVR-PAD’s vault system can secure multiple packages and can only be opened by authorized users. The RCVR-PAD will replace existing, free-standing mailboxes in suburban areas and our window-mounted model can be incorporated in both urban and suburban areas. Our RCVR-PAD uses two-way communication so a drone can verify that it has landed at the correct location and RCVR-PAD can verify the right drone has landed with the correct package. Once dual-verification has taken place, the RCVR-PAD’s security door slides open to accept the delivery and closes once the delivery is complete. The end-user receives a notification of the status of their package delivery and can retrieve the package at their convenience.  Valqari’s IP protection strategy will allow us to prevent imitators from capturing market share domestically and internationally. Only Valqari’s window or balcony-mounted mailboxes enable “last inch” delivery in densely populated areas. Valqari provides the most effective and comprehensive “last inch” solution, creating an environment for drone delivery to reach maximum potential."
