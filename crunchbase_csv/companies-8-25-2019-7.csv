No complicated software products going down at the worst possible time. No “digital divide” between rich and poor."

BACtrack,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bactrack,"Consumer Electronics, Fitness, Hardware, Health Diagnostics, mHealth, Sensor, Software, Wearables","Drink Smarter with BACtrack, The Leader in Breathalyzers.","San Francisco-based BACtrack is the U.S. leader in breathalyzers, offering a full range of innovative products for both personal and professional use.  When BACtrack was founded in 2001, breathalyzers were primarily for law enforcement use and costs were high. Keith Nothacker, CEO and Founder of BACtrack, recognized that someone could be arrested with a Blood Alcohol Content of 0.08%, but that the general public had no way to test and measure their own BAC. He developed the first line of consumer breathalyzers.  PIONEERING AN INDUSTRY In 2004, BACtrack was the first company to ever receive US FDA 510(k) marketing clearance to legally sell breathalyzers to consumers for personal use. In fact, BACtrack worked with the FDA to create the evaluation and regulatory criteria for the personal breathalyzer category, which became the benchmark against which all other products were tested.  Since then, the company has worked to simplify the product, reduce the cost	of the technology, and	increase consumer awareness.	 Today, BACtrack offers a wide range of breathalyzers for both personal and professional use, and they are used by consumers, businesses, schools, clinics, hospitals, law enforcement, and even the U.S. military around the world.  DEFINING THE SMARTPHONE REVOLUTION In April, 2013, BACtrack launched the BACtrack Mobile Breathalyzer, the first smartphone breathalyzer to combine professional-grade fuel cell sensor technology, Bluetooth®-connectivity, and app-enabled features. With BACtrack Mobile, users can obtain a BAC result, view safety information and monitor how alcohol affects the body at each BAC point. BACtrack's unique ZeroLine® feature also shows a user approximately how long alcohol will remain in their bloodstream after consumption.  BACtrack released its second smartphone enabled breathalyzer in July, 2014. The BACtrack Vio Smartphone Breathalyzer has many of the same features as BACtrack Mobile, but is packaged in a compact, keychain design. INDUSTRY AWARDS AND RECOGNITION BACtrack's suite of products continue to be recognized by top research and media publications. BACtrack is featured in the 2013 December issue of Popular Science. It received the 2013 Best of What's New Award (Popular Science's top honor) for its innovation in health. Popular Science stated BACtrack and the other award recipients are ""poised to change the world.""  In April 2014, the BACtrack Keychain Breathalyzer and BACtrack Mobile received Car and Driver's highest ratings in an industry wide comparison testing of the most accurate personal breathalyzers. CNET rated BACtrack Mobile as ""very good"" on the usability scale.  In the 2014 Edison Awards, BACtrack Mobile won a Bronze medal for the Security and Safety Category. It also won an Australian Good Design Award for being one of the best designed and most innovative products of the year across a range of fields and industries.  BACTRACK CONSUMPTION REPORT In June 2014, BACtrack was the first company to release alcohol related data to the public concerning US drinking habits via the BACtrack Consumption Report. The report is compiled from Blood	Alcohol	Content	(BAC) data collected anonymously via BACtrack Smartphone Breathalyzers, and will be updated regularly to provide insight into	alcohol	consumption patterns around the world. The goal	is	to	enlighten	the	general	public	on	alcohol	consumption	habits	so	that	 they 	become more responsible	drinkers. RETAIL PARTNERSHIPS BACtrack has forged extensive partnerships around the globe with the major retail and ecommerce stores. BACtrack breathalyzers are carried in over 10,000 retail locations across North America, including Best Buy, Costco, and Walgreen's, and are available at major online retailers such as Amazon, Walmart.com, Brookstone, and Drugstore.com.

Facing a heavy post-war migration to the area and its consequent automobile boom, these people discussed ways of easing the mounting congestion that was clogging the bridges spanning the Bay. In 1947, a joint Army-Navy review Board concluded that another connecting link between San Francisco and Oakland would be needed in the years ahead to prevent intolerable congestion on the Bay Bridge. The link? An underwater tube devoted exclusively to high-speed electric trains. Since 1911, visionaries had periodically brought up this Jules Verne concept.

In 1951, the State Legislature created the 26-member San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit Commission, comprised of representatives from each of the nine counties which touch the Bay.

All you have to do is download BaasBox, install it wherever you want and connect your application to the Box. You may install BaasBox on your laptop, on your server, on a PaaS provider (RedHat OpenShift, for instance) or on a IaaS provider (Amazon AWS).   Although similar to other cloud-computing developer tools, such as software as a service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and platform as a service (PaaS), BaaS is distinct from these other services because it specifically addresses the cloud-computing needs of web and mobile app developers by providing a unified means of connecting their apps to cloud services.   Currently, BaasBox provides only a little subset of features, and can be used via standard HTTP REST API calls. Soon the number of functions will grow along with its development.

Battlemap,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/overwatch,"Android, Apps, Casual Games, Hardware, iOS, Mobile, Software","Battlemap integrates features from combat video games into the real-life airsoft, paintball, and laser tag matches.","Battlemap bridges the gap between digital and physical gaming by bringing the core features of combat video games to a mobile application for use during real-life games of airsoft, paintball, and laser tag.  Gamers will now be able to see a satellite overview of the entire playing field and the real-time locations of teammates and opponents as they play.  Other features include team-restricted Bluetooth communication lines, as well as un-lockable special abilities and game modes to create the most immersive, real-life gaming experience possible.  Instead of technology limiting the capabilities of a video game as it does in gaming consoles, Overwatch enhances a physical game using nothing more than a smartphone. In addition to developing the smartphone app, Overwatch offers smartphone mounts to safely secure a user's device to their gun or forearm during gameplay. The gun-mounting system attaches an Android or iOS device to a standard picatinny rail mount during play.  Another option for users is the Personal Armband Mount.  The Personal Armband Mount, primarily to be used by paintball players—whose guns do not have a picatinny rail system—allows a player to secure the phone to their forearm during gameplay. Overwatch has partnered with Cybergun, the world leader in airsoft gun manufacturing, to bring Overwatch to market on a massive scale. Through Cybergun, Overwatch will have access to the shelves of over 9,000 retail stores in the U.S. and Europe—including Walmart, Cabela’s and Academy Sports—in addition to all the major online retailers in the airsoft industry. Product revenue will be generated from the sale of the hardware in stores and online, and from in-app purchases of perks and rewards (such as disabling the opponent’s radar or voice communications — http://www.youtube.com/overwatchapp). The iOS app completed and submitted to the Apple App store awaiting approval for release. The Android app is soon to follow, but the release date has not yet been set. The designs for the Personal and Rail Mount designs have been finalized and will be begin the manufacturing process within the next month. The Personal mount will be available online by October of 2014. The Rail Mount will be available in December of 2014. The Overwatch gaming experience targets over 25 million people, specifically the $70 billion gaming industry and ""outdoor gaming"" industry (consisting of airsoft, paintball, and laser tag players). Through OverwatchApp.com, Overwatch is building an community that brings together the digital and real-life combat gamers. The website will allow gamers to post scores, videos and comments of matches played, and will inform them of Overwatch events, announcements, and new products.  Overwatch expects the Overwatch app and products to reach $1.5M consumers worldwide in the next three years through in-store and online channels. The company already has $150k in convertible debt and $20k in equity investment as winners of the ARK Challenge competition. Overwatch is seeking a total additional raise of $300,000, in the form of convertible debt, to continue developing features for the next phases of the app and hardware, complete the website, and execute the marketing plan to the fullest extent. However, with a $50,000 match already committed to Overwatch, the team is seeking an additional $50,000 to secure a short burst of $100,000.  Forecasts show the Overwatch product has the potential to achieve positive cash flow mid-2015, and reach $10M in gross sales with 20% net margins by the end of 2016. Battlemap has already been approached by a number of online retailers, product manufacturers, and gaming location owners regarding additional products and licensing agreements. There has also been interest in military and law enforcement training applications. These opportunities are not fully developed and potential revenues are not currently included in their forecasts."

Bank of Hodlers,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bank-of-hodlers,"Banking, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, FinTech, Payments","Bank of Hodlers aims to build a banking system which is more swift, secure, and decentralized than traditional banks using blockchain.","Hi there! if you’re reading this, you’re probably like us – have pretty much all your wealth stored in digitized (or soon to be digitized) assets like money in your bank, mutual funds, stocks or real estate. You probably have a financial advisor guiding you through your investments, a manager from your bank who helps you stay on top of your mortgage payments and a government that prints money responsibly to not de-value your lifetime of savings.  But how do you know that the bank manager or your financial advisor has your best interests at heart instead of their own fee and commissions? Your contract explicitly states that they are not responsible for your loss even as they verbally assure you otherwise.  How do you know that the digital assets won’t be hacked (traditional bank websites get hacked all the time)? Or that your physical assets won’t be stolen(bank robberies) or taken by fraud (enough examples in real estate)? Governments fall all the time, or change their monetary policies - and your currency today can literally have no value tomorrow (Indian demonetization, Argentina, Venezuela). How do you know it won’t happen to your country? Do you ask these questions? Well, we do all the time.  To answer these questions and why we created the Bank of Hodlers, we have to dive into the details of how banking evolved. As early as the 2nd century BC, people who could save money started lending them out to people who could borrow and pay back with interest. Banking as an industry thrived in Italy and grew with the expansion of the Roman Empire.  During the 20th century, developments in telecommunications and computing caused major changes to banks' operations and let banks dramatically increase in size and geographic spread. This consolidated the industry and gave the power to a few firms. Fast forward to 2007: their recklessness caused the financial crisis of 2007–2008 forcing failure of many banks, including some of the world's largest banks. The government let the banks live by infusing 1.2 trillion dollars of the taxpayer’s money into a handful of banks and in turn, created the need, wave of innovation and a community for blockchain and the concept of decentralization to thrive.  Here’s Alan Greenspan (Chairman – Federal Reserve: 1987-2006), the guy who decided how much money to print in America, admitting that his model was flawed in 2008. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5lZPWNFizQ In 2009, something magical happened, Satoshi Nakamoto released his white paper which removed the need for a centralized authority to facilitate transactions in a purely peer to peer and decentralized fashion and making truly beneficial for every user holding the currency.  Some governments, after looking at the threat that bitcoin poses, have decided to take an anti-crypto stance. This ensures the network effect doesn’t happen at a scale where it replaces their national currency.  This is where we come in. At the Bank of Hodlers, we intend to treat your cryptocurrencies as a separate asset class and offer services to ensure technologies based on blockchain are usable as of today, negating the need for the network effects and government acceptance to come in.  We give every HODLer the ability to completely bank on blockchain today. Every once in a while, there’s a technology jump so large that completely leapfrogs every existing solution out there. Blockchain is this technology jump and the banks know this."
