The small workshop soon evolved into a national newspaper-pub­lish­ing house. Schweizer Illus­tri­erte was first pub­lished in 1911 us­ing letter­press. It was Switzer­land's most successful people mag­a­zine and remains so to this day. In 1959 Ringi­er took the Swiss public by surprise launch­ing the country's first tabloid, Blick. The concept of the publication’s style prompted vio­lent con­tro­ver­sy among readers but proved very successful. Ringi­er first ven­tured into the televi­sion busi­ness in 1984, founding the local TV programming compa­ny, Züriv­i­sion. In 1987, Ringi­er expanded abroad for the first time, to Asia. The compa­ny's first activ­ities in East­ern Eu­rope took place in 1990. Al­though the Inter­net only began gain­ing mo­mentum as a mass medium to­wards the end of the 1990s, Ringi­er rec­ognized its po­tential as early as 1996, and began to con­quer the electron­ic me­dia with the Blick On­line and CASH On­line websites. Ringi­er adopted a corporate strategy based on three ar­eas of busi­ness: pub­lish­ing, dig­ital busi­ness and entertain­ment in 2009. Launch­ing a joint ven­ture unique to the compa­ny’s history in 2010, Ringi­er partnered with German pub­lish­er Axel Springer to found Ringi­er Axel Springer Me­dia AG to boost busi­ness in Central Eu­rope."

Ripl,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ripl-io,"Analytics, Big Data, Social Media","Ripl tracks and reports on big data within the social sphere through clear, one-page style reports.","What is Ripl.io? Ripl.io is a bit like an online talent agency blended in with the Neilson rating system. It’s a place where the web’s most popular content sharers/curators can measure, tune, and learn to grow their popularity. Ripl.io connects its users with the brands they’re excited about, giving them opportunity to monetize their social media efforts. More specifically, Ripl.io gives you great web analytics for your Pinterest Boards and Flipboard Magazines, with more platforms on the way. Based on the topics you post about, the size of your audience, and the location you reside in, you may also get the opportunity to make a living just by continuing to share interesting and exclusive information online. Why is Ripl.io a good idea? Currently there aren’t very many options for online curators to make a living with their ability to mine internet gold. Which, unfortunately, means that they’re less likely to continue to spend hoards of time helping the rest of them tame the noisy web. Ripl.io is meant to incentivize and support the amazing work of their favorite pinners, posters and flippers. How did you come up with Ripl.io? Ripl.io was birthed within the world of online advertising. Which I still feel funny saying, and always get a few eye-rolls when I do. I came up in the professional world of online display advertising and microsites. Trust me, I’m as hopeful for change as you are. I was astonished by the budgets being invested in creating brand advertising through boxes, their old friend the “banner ad”. At the risk of being dramatic, It’s a bit like the tobacco industry. All the research and studies prove the harmfulness, yet the industry trucks on. It kept me up at night. There had to be a better way to tell the world your brand’s story. So I picked the brains of the smartest people I knew in the industry, and was happy to see I wasn’t the only one thinking about this problem, or brainstorming a solution. As an avid user of social media, and a hopeless early adopter, I was blown away by the popularity and usefulness of content aggregation sites. My obsession started with Digg, Reddit and Break, and then grew towards Pinterest and Flipboard. They’ve been witness to the rapid growth of the online world, it’s vastness is staggering, these sites added sanity. The hubs grew from the spokes. Online curation became somewhat of a celebrity. Overnight, everyday Janes and Joes could have millions of eager fans drooling over their Pin Boards. Trends on these sites influence more than their entertainment habits, they influenced their purchasing habits. I pawn over the top sneaker-head boards, ready to see what the freshest fruit Nike has to offer is.. and clicking through with card in hand. They inadvertently stumbled across the soul of the brands they love. Pictures and words drawn from real-life experiences and fostered through the fulfillment of a product’s promise. By immersing myself in the thought process of the brand marketer, then stepping back as a consumer, I recognized that the key to online marketing wasn’t shouting from your store-front, plastering fancy tag-lines everywhere, or hiring expensive celebrities.. it’s in the hearts of your advocates. Your fangirls and fanboys. Whether your business is just getting started, or an established gorilla in its industry, they’ve proven that participating and encouraging your brand’s online advocates are your most effective channels for marketing. It starts with amazing products, continues with simple yet effective branded content, and is then amplified through your brand’s top tastemakers. Who’s Ripl.io for? Ripl.io is for anyone who’s excited to grow and cultivate a social media audience. Whether you aspire to be, or are currently renowned as, a subject matter expert, Ripl.io can help you better understand how well received your content sharing is by your online community. Ripl.io is a place for brands to learn who their biggest online advocates are. Get insights on what your audience cares most about and how to better meet their needs and expectations for things like branded entertainment, product insights, and feedback.

Rivada Networks provides advanced communications solutions to the public safety community at local, state and federal levels.  Rivada Networks' technologies enable public safety agencies to retain absolute control over their own dedicated broadband networks, while enabling the generation of valuable revenues from unused capacity, when available. Following the events of 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, Congress allocated dedicated radio spectrum in the 700 Mhz band, to US public safety. The legislation allows for non-priority access to the spectrum for competitive commercial users.  Rivada’s core technology, Dynamic Spectrum Arbitrage Tiered Priority Access (DSATPA) works out to the very edge of the network, allowing public safety absolute priority access with instant (millisecond) pre-emption in the event of an emergency situation – thus guaranteeing first responders access to the highest quality bandwidth capacity at the moment they need it most. Meanwhile, in the extended periods of time when the public safety broadband network has significant extra bandwidth to spare, DSATPA allows that capacity to be dynamically auctioned in a fully competitive 'on demand' process to competing commercial entities – providing more choice and availability to industry and consumers while generating essential revenue for the public safety mission. DSATPA is a game changer for the way in which spectrum is consumed, maximising the efficiency of the radio spectrum bandwidth resource and unlocking the potential for more extensive high capacity broadband networks.  Rivada has served public safety for a decade, helping to meet their unique and critical communications challenges. Rivada Networks' work has been recognised for helping to save lives during times of severe crisis, such as Hurricane Katrina and multiple other emergencies and disasters. Rivada Networks' commitment to helping the men and women who stand on the front lines of emergency situations is absolute and their dedicated team of innovators work tirelessly to bring their unparalleled expertise to the task."

Casual and commercial drivers can offer transportation directly to their riders through RideConnect, thereby keeping what money they make. With RideConnect, people in cities, towns or any other type of community can organize their own rideshare even where other car service options don't exist. Features RideBoard A centralized scheduler for rides. Riders can schedule their rides with their preferred drivers up to 24 hrs in advance. Drivers can announce their trips so that riders can ask for a ride. My Community A dynamic list of riders and drivers sourced from your private contacts. You control who's in and who's out. You can never rideshare with a total stranger because everyone in your community is either directly connected to you or through someone else in your community. RideMode See where the rider is, how long to the pick up, and the progress of the ride. Communicate with one another using the walkie-talkie. Best Practices Do not use RideConnect in places where such services are illegal. RideConnect is not a taxi service. RideConnect is software that can be used by taxi and car services in order to offer their transportation services to customers. When giving people a ride, do not handle your phone and drive at the same time, this is dangerous. RideConnect is inherently private. The only way people can get onto your Community is if you add them outside the app. You are responsible for who is a part of your community. You can manage your community by removing people from your phone book, or unfriending them on Facebook.

The Italian immigrants were of humble origin, mainly from rural areas of Italy. Brazil was seen as a new land full of opportunities. It is worth remembering that Italy was undergoing a crisis of employment in the second half of the nineteenth century, generated mainly by industrialization. Italy had many people looking for work in other countries and Brazil needed hand labor. After the Slavery Abolition (1888), farmers opted for european laborers, rather than integrating the former slaves into the labor market. The Brazilian government campaigned in Italy to attract these Italians to work in Brazilian agriculture. Ricci family arrived in 1918 and went to work as ""settlers"" on coffee plantations of Alta Mogiana region in the state of São Paulo. When CMNP - Companhia Melhoramentos Norte do Paraná began the colonization of northern Paraná, the family, now bigger, acquired their first property in the town of Terra Boa - PR. In 1975 there was a frost that decimated the whole state coffee business. The family was seeking new opportunities to continue the passion for coffee. After years of research, they found at Monte Carmelo, Minas Gerais, the ideal place to start. The terroir is ideal for the production of specialty coffee, and the ideal altitude of 960m and climate with well-defined seasons (wet summer and mild dry winter). The main feature of this region which distinguished from the others is the low humidity in the time of harvesting, favoring dry grains naturally"
