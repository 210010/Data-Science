Phase I of Gilmore Homes - Gilmore Loans, LLC., includes designing and building our first 100 single family homes for rent/lease herein Atlanta, Georgia.

"Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP",https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/gibson-dunn-crutcher-llp,Legal,"From one practice group to another, from one generation to the next, there is something unique in the halls at Gibson Dunn: a seamless","From one practice group to another, from one generation to the next, there is something unique in the halls at Gibson Dunn: a seamless commitment to excellence that has continued for over a century by an elite group of lawyers who come to serve their clients selflessly and to achieve results. This is our story. In May 1872, a tall, 34 year-old, red-bearded lawyer stepped down from the stage-coach at the Plaza of Los Angeles. Corporate attorney John Bicknell had his sights on building a law practice. What greeted him at the stage was a humble little pueblo with dusty unpaved street, no industry and scant business. He saw a pueblo of narrow streets and alleys between decrepit adobe buildings roofed with ""brea"" from tar pits west of the city. Bicknell, who had summed up his philosophy this way when counseling a younger lawyer, ""The safe way is to select a business that you will be satisfied to follow and build up a business of your own."" He began to follow his own advice. By the 1880s, he had attracted one of the region's most important clients, the Southern Pacific Railroad. It took time to select a quality partner. But in 1890, Bicknell, a Republican, teamed with Walter Trask, a Democratic litigator, thus launching the unbroken chain of partnership that today is Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. Also launched was a set of unique firm attributes. Those included selecting only quality lawyers; balancing ideas across the political spectrum; and providing powerful resources in both transactional and litigation-related legal services. More than a century later, these attributes still define today's Gibson Dunn. In 1897 Judge James Gibson joined the firm, thus instituting another Gibson Dunn tradition – hiring lawyers who make an impact in their communities. In 1903, in a move that created the largest firm in Los Angeles, Bicknell, Trask and Gibson merged their practice with that of former Los Angeles City Attorney William Dunn and former Assistant City Attorney Albert Crutcher. Carried out at the behest of a client in order to create a ""full-service"" firm, the combination was called an ""experiment"" in the local press. It has worked ever since. Nearly 100 years later, the press recently dubbed the firm ""The Rescue Squad"" for its response and service to clients in legal need. Another article remarked that it remains easier to get into the CIA than to become a lawyer at Gibson Dunn. The firm grew as the region grew, into both Northern and Southern California, and both nationally and internationally. By the 1970s, Gibson Dunn had offices in London and Paris. Shortly thereafter, the firm took the bold step of launching its practice in the nation's capital and New York. Since 2000, the firm has further expanded in Europe, South America, the Middle East and Asia. As John Bicknell might say, the firm has ""built up a business"", based on those attributes of quality, balance and impact and on an unrelenting mission of achieving success for clients – a mission shared today by approximately 1000 lawyers worldwide."

Most people don’t realize that gift cards could lose value as a result of inactivity or from frequent monthly service fees. Also some people may lose their gift cards or forget to use them, so why don’t you cash them out instead of losing money? Here is an excerpt, [source: Nolan]: “From a fiscal perspective, statistics show that gift cards aren't the savviest holiday gift choice for the consumer. For starters, between 8 and 10 percent of gift cards go unredeemed. They sit in the back of people's wallets, hide away in clothes drawers or get tossed into the trash accidentally. Those stray gift cards added up to a whopping unspent $8 billion in 2007” How do Gift Cards Lose Value? Gift cards are often charged fees, ranging from “limit inactivity (dormancy) fees” and “service fees”, as such gift cards lose their value like water going down a slow drain. Most people are unaware of the monthly service fees, inactivity fees and dormancy fees that are charged against their card balances until the entire value is depleted. A gift card that starts out with a balance of $45, for example, may be charged a non-use fee of anywhere from two dollars per month. At two dollars per month, the $45 initial balance will be reduced to $21 by the end of the first year. Getting full value of your gift cards is just one of many reasons you should cash out your gift cards at “GiftCardToCash” "

It's the world's first B2C (business to customer) platform on which brand products are traded like on the stock exchange. Hundreds of online merchants offer their products on this platform. Users can buy at the current offer price from the cheapest of the registered merchants. The whole order and payment process is conducted by Gimahhot, while the merchant's only obligation is to deliver the package to the customer. The user's advantage is that he doesn't have to signup with all those different shops. Instead he buys everything at Gimahhot. The new and unique thing about the buying process is that prices are genuinely determined by supply and demand. Not only can the users buy at the offered prices, they can place bids as well. Unlike in an auction, those bids are not placed for a single auction of some merchant, but they are open to the whole market. Everyone of say - 45 merchants that offer a green, 4 GB Nano iPod - can react on a bid that a user has placed for that product. Reactions to user's bids can be set up to be processed automatically: Merchants can configure several options, e.g. ""I accept all bids that are up to 3% below my offer price."""
