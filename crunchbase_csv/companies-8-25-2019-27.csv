Quietly it has been building market share in the legal research market for lawyers, with more than 800,000 subscribers.   Fastcase's legal research service is poised to make some major changes in the way that lawyers access the law.  It sorts results algorithmically, like Google, bringing the best results to the top.  But more than that, it incorporates citation analysis right into the results, so you can see which cases are most cited.  The service also allows customized results -- users can sort results a dozen ways to emphasize what's important to them. The service is also the first to move legal research beyond the tired ""search-results-document"" paradigm, with cool data visualization tools that create beautiful, four-dimensional maps of search results.  The most important cases jump off the pages in these maps -- just one of many interesting tools that make Fastcase a smarter alternative for legal research. This is a paradigm shift.  In the past, the emphasis in legal research was on taxonomic or editorial tools that helped lawyers or legal researchers find the most important cases, kind of like Yahoo's categories helped people find pages on the early Web.  Fastcase allows users to organize the law with search tools and intelligent algorithms, much like Google did in the Web.  And like Google, once people use Fastcase's search tools, they find it difficult to go back to the old, pre-chewed editorial indexes of traditional legal research. In February of 2010, Fastcase introduced the first legal research application for the iPhone (www.fastcase.com/iPhone) -- which is free to download and free to use (free registration required).  Apple has ranked the app as one of its featured ""What's Hot"" applications, and it has been one of the most downloaded free reference apps in iTunes.  Fastcase released the first iPad app for legal research in July 2010. In 2011, it released the first legal research app for iPad, and in 2012, it released the first legal research app for Android."

We call it ""the event-based security model"". Most of the video surveillance software products currently available on the market operate in two categories: time of recording and source. This means a user can only see what was recorded at a particular time frame on each of the installed cameras. Faceter makes video surveillance systems much more capable by adding face recognition technology. Faceter can build a list of office workers, family members, restaurant patrons; generate a report on who was detected and when, in the cameras' scope; find each occurrence of a specific person at a specific location and retrieve specific records from the archive.Faceter can be taught to respond to certain events. For example, the system can send SMS to parents when their child arrives from school, and transmit information to integrated systems via available APIs. It could be a smart house management platform that will send a command to warm up food in the microwave. In the next two years we will make Faceter support protocols for several leading smart house platforms and standard callback APIs. When integrated with urban services, Faceter can be configured to perform specific actions, such as sending alerts to 911 if there are signs of violence or incipient crime."

Family Dollar Stores,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/family-dollar-stores,Retail,Family Dollar is a neighborhood dollar discount store chain.,"In 1958, a 21-year-old entrepreneur with an interest in merchandising became intrigued with the idea of operating a low-overhead, self-service retail store. Leon Levine believed he could offer his customers a variety of high-quality, good value merchandise for under $2. Because he had grown up in his family’s retail store, he understood value, quality and customer satisfaction.   In November 1959, Leon Levine opened the first Family Dollar store in Charlotte, North Carolina, and was on his way to becoming a retailing legend. Right from the start, he had a well-developed philosophy of what Family Dollar would be and how it would operate, a philosophy from which he and his management team have never strayed. The concept is a simple one, “the customers are the boss, and you need to keep them happy.”   He created a general floorplan that he used in each of his stores that allowed customers to easily shop for their favorite products in any Family Dollar store. With the stores uniformly laid out and stocked, store managers were able to focus on providing good customer service. This concept for a self-serve, cash-and-carry neighborhood discount store in low to middle income neighborhoods proved so successful that today Family Dollar is a chain with over 8,000 stores from Maine to California."

It is ideally suited for villa construction and high rise buildings.  There are two manufactured components: lightweight concrete blocks and pre-stressed t-beams.   We have invested in equipment, licenses and inventory and are seeking additional capital of $800,000 to establish a commercial scale factory in the Gulf region that will produce two villas per week.   There is overwhelming demand for the our products in the Gulf region, and to secure a portion of this we need to expand production capacity and add equipment to upgrade from the pilot scale mobile factory we already own to a fully functioning factory.   Investors capital can be fully repaid from a project of only 50 villas, or only six months of production.  To enable installation of our system, we have partnered with a 600+ person, Canadian owned construction company that is able to execute projects of any size.   Quality labour supply is a key issue in the Gulf construction industry.  Labour productivity is significantly higher with FastBuild so total labour requirements can be 60% less.   Speed of construction is a primary selling feature of the FastBuild system.  Whereas a project of 30 villas may take 18 months to complete, the same project with FastBuild could be completed in 12 months.  This represents a tremendous savings in overhead and dramatically improves return on invested capital.   FastBuild blocks can be used for partition walls, and in this case the savings are excellent => 17-24%.
