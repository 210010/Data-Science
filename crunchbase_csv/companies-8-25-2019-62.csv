Matrix,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/matrix-org,"Developer APIs, Enterprise Software, Internet of Things, Open Source, Telecommunications, VoIP","Open Source, Interoperable IP Comms","Matrix.org is an ambitious not-for-profit open source initiative defining a new open standard for decentralised, persistent and interoperable communications over the internet. Matrix.org’s aim is to fix the problem of fragmented IP-communications between devices, people and services, and make them as seamless and interoperable as possible. Matrix addresses use cases like VoIP, IoT and instant messaging but its real potential and ultimate mission is to be a generic messaging and data synchronization system for the web - allowing anyone and anything to easily communicate securely, maintaining full conversation history with no single points of control or failure. Any developer can use Matrix to easily create and host their own feature-rich real-time communication apps or add such features to an existing service whilst building on the Matrix community of users. Existing communication services can also easily join in and integrate with the Matrix ecosystem. The Matrix standard specifies simple RESTful HTTP APIs for securely transmitting and replicating JSON data between Matrix-capable clients, servers and services. Clients send data by PUTing it to a ‘room’ on their server, which then replicates the data over all the Matrix servers participating in this ‘room’. This data is signed using a blockchain-style signature to mitigate tampering, and the federated traffic is encrypted with HTTPS and signed with each server’s private key to avoid spoofing. Replication follows eventual consistency semantics, allowing servers to function even if offline or after data-loss by resynchronizing missing history from other participating servers. End-to-end encryption ensures data at rest is only readable by the room participants. The result is that data transmitted over Matrix is never stored in any single place, and is instead securely shared on a purely need-to-know basis between relevant parties, with control of access residing solely with the author.

MDsave,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mdsave,"E-Commerce, Health Care, Marketplace, Medical","MDsave provides a single online location for consumers to research, compare, and purchase medical services with total cost transparency.","MDsave has announced the addition of laboratory/pathology services to its medical service listings.  With the proliferation of high deductible health plans, the push for price transparency is a hot topic.  MDsave, a Brentwood, TN based healthcare startup, is aiming to be an “Expedia of health care”.  MDsave is the first e-commerce company to offer a single online resource for consumers to research, compare, and purchase healthcare services at significant discounts.  Launched June 2012, MDsave is already in 3 large metro markets and likely to expand to another 4 this year. MDsave is in partnership with SSM Healthcare Oklahoma, parent organization to St Anthony hospital.  The partnership encompasses more than 225 healthcare providers across 20 locations and over 200 procedures and services that include MRIs, flue shots, CT scans, and specialty visits. With the current challenges in the healthcare marketplace, this couldn’t come at a better time for St. Anthony’s patients and the Oklahoma City community. Because an individual can purchase medical procedures and services directly from physicians, MDSave eliminates the complexity that many are currently experiencing with health insurance exchanges. Also, with thousands of Americans temporarily finding themselves with canceled health plans, MDSave helps these individuals to immediately save on their current pressing and preventive healthcare needs. Over the long term, as government leaders work through these challenges and more Americans sign up for high-deductible plans, the need for reducing out-of-pocket costs will only increase. MDsave is also in partnership with Weatherford Regional Medical Center outside of Fort Worth, whose parent company is Community Health Systems, one of the nation’s leading hospital systems.  Weatherford currently offers imaging services and has just added all of their lab/pathology services as well.  Outpatient surgeries and physician office visits will be added to the listing soon. “Partnering with Weatherford Regional Medical Center is an important step toward making healthcare more accessible, affordable and transparent in Texas,” said MDSave co-founder and CEO Paul Ketchel. “We know that the cost of preventive treatments like diagnostic imaging is often a factor in consumers neglecting to have them. A recent National Cancer Institute study found that CT scans reduced the risk of death from lung cancer by 20 percent. We hope that our partnership will increase Texans’ access to quality imaging and, as a result, help save lives.” For example, an MRI would typically cost a patient without insurance $2,074.77, while a patient with a high deductible plan would pay $1,231.96. By researching and booking through MDSave, that same patient could get an MRI at Weatherford Regional Medical Center for $425, resulting in a more than 65 percent savings. A patient who needs an X-ray would typically pay $181.26 without insurance and $107.66 with a high deductible plan. Through MDSave, he or she could pay $82 at Weatherford, resulting in a more than 23 percent savings. The typical CT scan would cost an uninsured patient $1,374.53 and a high-deductible patient $816.41. An MDSave user could book and get the scan for $350 at Weatherford, at more than 57 percent savings. MDsave announced its latest partnership in the Nashville market in April.   In an effort to bring more consumers greater access to colonoscopies, AMSURG Corp. and MDSave are launching a pilot program to introduce bundled pricing for the procedure to two Nashville-area surgery centers. Associated Endoscopy in Hermitage and St. Thomas Medical Group Endoscopy Center in Nashville will offer a fixed cost for the procedure to high deductible, self-pay and under-insured patients at a lower rate than those individuals would typically pay. Those who are insured under the Affordable Care Act’s healthcare exchange marketplace will also be eligible for the program. Consumers can access these savings through the MDsave website, www.MDSave.com. Experts recommend colonoscopies for everyone aged 50 and above, and the pilot program will create an option for patients who might otherwise be deterred by the idea that a colonoscopy is financially out of reach. Bundled pricing means that qualified patients will pay a single, set price for all costs associated with the procedure. Without bundled pricing, these patients would receive multiple bills for charges like facility fees and anesthesia fees, which can be confusing and lead to unexpected costs for the patient. This marks only the second time that colonoscopies have been offered with completely bundled pricing – the first being the MDsave partnership with DDSI, a gastroenterology center in Oklahoma City. Going one-step further, this program includes any and all diagnostic procedures that take place during the colonoscopy, such as biopsies, in the bundled price. These procedures are not always covered by insurance when a screening colonoscopy is ordered.  The average cost of a colonoscopy in Nashville is $5,175 for uninsured patients and $3,583 for those with a high deductible. With the MDSave partnership, Associated Endoscopy and the St. Thomas Medical Group Endoscopy Center are able to reduce those fees to $1,795 for patients who qualify, representing a significant savings to consumers.  “Through this pilot program, we are able to provide Nashville-area consumers with a potentially lifesaving procedure at a more affordable and easier to understand price,” said Paul Ketchel, MDSave CEO and co-founder. “This complements our growing suite of healthcare services offered in our community and with providers in other areas across the country."
