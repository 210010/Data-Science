id Software,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/id-software,"Developer Tools, Enterprise Software, Gaming","id Software is an American video game development company with its headquarters in Richardson, Texas.","id Software is responsible for some of the best-selling and most critically acclaimed video games of all time. Located in Mequite Texas, since their founding in 1991.  Ushering in a new era of interactive entertainment with genre-defining blockbusters like Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM and QUAKE, id has secured itself a place in gaming history as one of the fathers of the modern video game.  They were one of the first game shops to make the shareware distribution model work.  It all began on May 5, 1991, when id Software, fresh off the heels of its success with the Commander Keen series of titles, gave the PC gaming world a glimpse of the future with the shareware release of Wolfenstein 3D. A shot of pure adrenaline, Wolfenstein 3D thrust gamers into a frenetic first-person universe of relentless action that would forever change the face of gaming.  Widely recognized as the original first-person shooter, Wolfenstein 3D was later inducted into the Computer Gaming World ""Hall of Fame"" for shaping the overall direction of the video game industry.  Then, on December 10, 1994, id unleashed DOOM on the world. A technically stunning opus of heart-stopping action, unspeakable horror and pure gaming bliss, DOOM heralded a paradigm shift in video games. Hardcore PC games were going mainstream.  Selling millions of copies and chalking up tens of millions of downloads as shareware, DOOM remains one of the most popular PC games ever. And the title's impact on the gaming world is still felt today.  With DOOM, id Software put the shareware distribution model on the map, with the game's runaway success owing a debt to the growth of Internet distribution. The company has continued to support shareware and other non-traditional means of distribution, influencing the way companies market and sell video games.  DOOM also introduced multiplayer gaming to the masses, allowing players to compete in intense 4-player LAN or head-to-head modem competitions.  id Software didn't stop there, the team of innovators also made DOOM's source code available to their fan base, encouraging would-be game designers to modify the game and create their own levels, or ""mods."" Fans were free to distribute their mods of the game, as long as the updates were offered free of charge to other enthusiasts. The mod community took off, giving the game seemingly eternal life on the Internet. In fact, id discovered many of their current employees and development partners based on mods that were created and distributed over the Internet.  DOOM and its sequels went on to enjoy tremendous sales on virtually every gaming platform available - from the Sega Genesis to the Game Boy Advance.  The next quantum leap in PC gaming came from id Software in 1996 with the release of QUAKE. Based on an all-new graphics engine, QUAKE was the first truly 3D video game, allowing players to interact with the virtual worlds created by id like never before. Gamers were free to look and move in any direction, giving the game designers at id the freedom and ability to create incredibly immersive environments in this epic, single-player game.  id Software continued the tradition of QUAKE, with QUAKE II in 1997. Supporting multiplay for up to 32 players simultaneously, QUAKE II was a watershed hit for the company, selling more than one million copies, despite it's steep hardware requirements. By now, it had become clear that id's games were reason enough to upgrade, or even buy, personal home computers.  In 1999, the easy-going guys from Mesquite further cemented their place in gaming lore with the ultimate deathmatch experience, QUAKE III Arena and the QUAKE III: Team Arena add-on pack. Designed to be the ultimate multiplayer experience, QUAKE III Arena has become the defacto standard for professional gamers and is the game of choice for tournaments around the world. A QUAKE III Arena tournament is the centerpiece of id's annual QuakeCon tournament and LAN party, played every summer near the company's headquarters in Mesquite. QuakeCon 2001 winners alone pulled in a combined $50,000 in cash and prizes.  In 2001, id Software teamed up with Gray Matter Interactive and Nerve Software to develop Return to Castle Wolfenstein, a re-imagining of the original classic, Wolfenstein 3D. Built around the Quake III Arena graphics engine, Return to Castle Wolfenstein introduced a new generation of gamers to the epic series that started it all. In its first two months of release, Return to Castle Wolfenstein shipped over one million units worldwide, and has been widely acclaimed as one of the best computer games of 2001.  The company also has enjoyed success licensing its revolutionary technology to other developers. To date, id's game engines have powered blockbuster titles from other producers, including Call of Duty, Soldier of Fortune, Half-Life, Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, Star Trek: Elite Force, Heretic, Hexen and more.  In August of 2004, id Software released the next chapter in the DOOM legacy, Featuring a new, mind-blowing gaming engine from John Carmack, bringing a terrifying new storyline based on the original masterpiece."

IdeaFlow,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ideaflow,"Artificial Intelligence, B2B, SaaS",A human-AI hybrid “shared brain” for organizations ,"We’re a startup from MIT that came out of research working to extend the human mind into the computer. Our core product is a “shared brain” for organizations -- a human-AI hybrid Web platform that enables teams of analysts to collaboratively create, visualize, and analyze networks of information, both manually and by integrating previously stagnant data sources. We’ve raised $1.8M from top angels including Jim Pallotta, the CTO of Reddit and the director of the MIT Media Lab, and are in private beta with several major customers. These include Silicon Valley Bank, with whom we recently closed a $200k/year annual recurring revenue deal. The product has implications far beyond finance, however. Right now, knowledge in organizations is siloed. This is the root of many problems. For instance, in research (abstractly speaking), one paper might say “a=b” and another might say “b=c” but unless you read the right pair of papers you’ll never realize that “a=c”. Moreover, in large organizations, people with related ideas can’t find each other. Similar problems plague many domains of analytical work. IdeaFlow has piqued the interest of Fields Medalist mathematician/collaborative theorem proving pioneer Tim Gowers, Category Theory for the Sciences author David Spivak, and NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). Video Previews: -Graph view: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7kEWftAUsY -Bullet view: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0JGfIYcEGw The reason this single piece of software applies across domains is that it’s a tool to augment a fundamental part of human intelligence. Our goal is to create a low-friction, smart notebook that allows you to capture insights like they exist in your brain: interconnected. It’s a practical implementation of the sort of personal/group knowledge base system AI thinkers have dreamed of since Vannevar Bush proposed the Memex <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex>. This will not only be a boon for those fed up with Evernote, but the first step towards creating a platform for collaborative cognition, which we see to be a necessary step towards automating cognition. We are a lean team, are based in the San Francisco Bay Area (but may take remote), and are looking for someone with significant JavaScript experience to play a core role in our company. We’re one of the most intense React applications on the Web and have needed to go as far as submitting PRs to ImmutableJS to build our platform (for this library https://github.com/IdeaFlowCo/evolving-immutable). We’re also hiring an iOS engineer who wants to build the best-ever, low-friction personal notes app. If you’re obsessed with mind mapping/keeping lists of ideas/personal information management, are into building communities/connecting people with related ideas, or are frustrated with the paradigm of Google for performing thorough research on the Web, we would love to talk with you regardless.

The oil and the gas sections are separated by a short single-compartment distance piece vented to the atmosphere. The vent lines for oil and gas could be collected and checked from time to time to control the status of the seals. The gas section is non-lubricated and due to the separation and the double seals, the oil carry-over is virtually none. The flexibility of the hydraulic system helps in having compressors and boosters that could accept a wide range of inlet pressures. Some of our units could also be used as compressor/boosters to fill and then intake gas from a high-pressure storage in order to achieve high flow-rate in a direct fill. The booster compressor is also the most suitable solution for daughter refueling stations as they do not need to reduce the pressure from the mobile storages being able to accept a wide inlet pressure range. Idro Meccanica compressors could have a maximum of five stages in one cylinder. The best-sold models are two and three stage compressors/boosters. Most of the units could also be supplied in twin version with two compressors assembled on the same frame in order to reduce installation space. The twin solution could also be used with two different models in order to combine a booster with a low-pressure compressor. The selection of the correct model is usually carried-out together with the potential customer taking into consideration the type of gas, available inlet pressure, required outlet pressure and rate of flow.
