Each currency exchange marketplace (for example GBP to EUR) gives the customer a choice: exchange immediately at the best rate available (usually no worse than 0.5% from the interbank rate, and sometimes better than the interbank rate), or place an order at a better exchange rate and wait to be matched off by another customer exchanging on the opposite market (for example EUR to GBP).

All exchanges are anonymous - the customer only deals with CurrencyFair. CurrencyFair is regulated by the Irish Financial Regulator as an Authorised Payments Institution under the European Payment Services Regulations 2009.  Authorised Payment Institutions (as opposed to Small Payments Institutions) are required to provide safeguards around client funds during the exchange and transfer process.

Over 350 people have received CMX001 to date, with a growing body of evidence supporting the drug's antiviral activity in humans. Clinical studies of CMX001 include an ongoing Phase 2 study of the prevention/control of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients (CMX001-201), a Phase 2 study being initiated for the treatment of adenovirus (AdV) infection in pediatric and adult hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients (CMX001-202), and an Open-Label Study (CMX001-350) for the treatment of any of 12 different dsDNA viral infections, including AdV, herpes viruses such as CMV, herpes simplex virus and Epstein Barr virus, polyoma viruses such as BK virus and JC virus, and pox viruses. The Open-Label Study builds on Chimerixâ€™s extensive experience working with clinicians at over 55 leading institutions in the United States, Canada, Europe and Israel who have sought CMX001 for the treatment of more than 150 immunocompromised patients under Emergency INDs. CMX001 has been well tolerated in all studies. CMX001 is also being developed as a medical countermeasure in the event of a smallpox release. Chimerix has received significant federal funding for the development of CMX001 as a medical countermeasure against smallpox from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Chimerix is developing CMX157 for the treatment of HIV infection including those caused by multi-drug resistant viruses. A Phase 1 clinical study has been completed demonstrating that the compound is well tolerated and that the active antiviral, TFV-PP, was measurable in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after a single dose and remained detectable for six days, indicating that it may be suitable for once-weekly dosing. Led by a world-class antiviral drug development team, Chimerix is also leveraging the company's extensive chemical library to pursue new treatments for hepatitis C virus, flu, malaria and other global public health needs."

Remember when “collaborating” on a document just meant sending around a copy and adding comments, and how easy it was to end up with multiple out-of-sync versions? Then came the cloud, and you could see someone editing a document in real time. Suddenly you knew what digital collaboration really meant. We believe data should work that way as well. Teams should collaborate in real time, sharing controlled access to original sources. When a change is made, that change should be seen instantly across every platform. Any applications referencing that data should be updated automatically. You should be able to see who made the change, and when. There should be no worries about versioning, and no such thing as outdated data. Data owners can see everyone who has access, and approve or reject every change suggested.

Our technology is p2p network platforms and protocol first - protocol suite, software that implements those protocols and provides client software and infrastructure for p2p networks. Its based on Ethereum and we call it Autonity - the protocol, the Geth-based client. We use our technology to build p2p networks and dFMI. P2p networks are private, member-owned and governed networks that enable peer-to-peer transfer of financial value and automation of contractual and fiduciary operations without reliance on trusted third-parties. Such decentralised networks can interact with one another, creating a wider ecosystem of value and leveraging the network effect, and they can form part of a dFMI. dFMI is a new concept, one that builds on the security and resilience guarantees of distributed ledger and systems engineering to provide a platform for tokenising value and transferring its ownership between participants on that or, by cross-platform exchange, on other platforms. We believe that our technology will drive adoption of a next-generation dFMI where intermediaries are removed, incentive structures encourage self-regulation, and risks are mitigated and reduced to the maximum. dFMI doesn't just provide a cryptographically secure environment for market participants to transact, it provides a peer-to-peer model that removes financial intermediaries and engenders a wider ecosystem for value transfer across platforms and pre- post-trade processes. dFMI works to mitigate concentration and liquidity risk, reduce settlement cycles to real-time, remove friction, and lower the transaction cost of economic exchange. Clearmatics is a company with a strong belief in the open source movement and good ties to the Ethereum community. We also work closely with the Ethereum Foundation, and are an active member of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA)."

Curb began in 2007 as RideCharge, an online service for business travelers to manage the booking and expensing of taxi rides and other local ground transportation. It soon developed a broader consumer focus, hastened by the adoption of smartphone technology. In our second iteration, Curb was Taxi Magic, the first mobile app for ordering a ride, on-demand.

Over the next five years, we built a nationwide network of riders, drivers, and taxi companies. In that time, our technology powered millions of rides and highlighted the challenges facing everyday travelers. In August 2014, Taxi Magic became Curb to deliver an improved ride experience and consumer choice to ground travelers everywhere. All rides begin and end at the curb, and our technology improves the entire experience from curb to curb by eradicating underlying pain points and making ground travel seamless and hassle-free.  Now, Curb is consistently ranked in the Top 50 for “Travel & Tourism” in the App Store and the Android Marketplace.
