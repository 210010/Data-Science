Modern learning science has identified the problem with traditional skills training methods such as classroom, online, books, videos, keynotes and seminars. These methods do not align with the brain’s ‘natural’ learning cycle and fail to create permanent memories. This results in training programs that fail to achieve their objectives, poor skill adoption, and no change in personal or enterprise performance.  SageCrowd has created the sageCrowd Collaborative Learning Platform; the learning sciences training methodology, the SageCrowd Way; and specific training programs based on the works of top authors.  At the heart of the sageCrowd Way is Insight-Scaffolding®, a sequence of activities invoking reflections and insights. This revolutionary approach identifies invoking ‘reflection’ as the key to creating ‘personal insights’. Insights are the pathway to idea creation and idea testing; the key steps in the learning cycle that distinguishes short- and long-term memory. By invoking a sequence of reflections & insights, learners scaffold skills naturally, layer upon layer.  The proprietary training methodology, The SageCrowd Way, combines collaborative learning capability with Insight-Scaffolding® sequencing to create a fundamentally different learning environment that can deliver a greater ROI on training and substantially improve enterprise performance."

By increasing the number of new customers, retention, and satisfaction of existing customers, our client has returned the favor by creating ample advancement opportunities for team members. With a clear and concise growth path, we look to train entry level marketing and sales professionals into successful branch managers.

SantoSolve,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/santosolve,"Biotechnology, Clinical Trials, Health Care",SantoSolve develops topical analgesic products with non-radioactive strontium as the active substance.,"SantoSolve is developing topical analgesic products based on non-radioactive strontium as the active substance. The Development program was initiated based on experimental clinical use of strontium-based products showing evidence of strong local analgesic effects on several localized pain conditions of both nociceptive and neuropatic origin. No significant adverse effects associated with the treatment was reported. The companyâ€™s lead product, 2PX, is topically administered, utilizing dermal penetration enhancers for delivery of the active agent to its subdermal site of action. Phase I safety and pharmacology studies showed the active agent to have low systemic bioavailability, and only few and minor adverse effects were observed at the site of administration. In open label Phase II clinical trials, the product has shown strong analgesic effect in both nociceptive and neuropatic pain conditions. In follow up, placebo controlled trials, the analgesic effect of the product has been further documented. In the companyâ€™s most advanced pain indication under study, osteoarthritis, the company has recently completed the Phase II program.These trials supports the open label results and document statistically that the analgesic effect in patients treated with  2PX is superior to that observed with placebo treatment."
