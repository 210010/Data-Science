Ferroli Limited,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ferroli-limited,"Commercial, Industrial",Ferroli Limited is range of domestic and commercial boilers and renewable energy.,"Ferroli Limited is range of domestic and commercial boilers and renewable energy. From the company’s original head office in San Bonifacio, near the Italian city of Verona, where it was founded by Dante Ferroli in 1955, Ferroli now operates in 14 countries across Europe and Asia. For 60 years, the company’s objective has been to drive innovation in the heating industry to produce appliances that are highly energy efficient, superbly built and suited to a very wide range of specifications. The UK operation began in the late 1980s when the UK export market was identified as being a promising one. In 1988 Ferroli joined forces with Brassware Sales, a company based in Minworth, West Midlands, which was importing heating products from Italian manufacturers, and they took on the name Brassware Ferroli. The success of this joint venture proved the UK market to be a viable one and in 1997, after nine years of continued growth, the two companies went their separate ways and Ferroli UK Ltd was established. By keeping a very keen eye on what the market demanded and ensuring that it kept pace with its competitors, Ferroli UK swiftly expanded until it outgrew the Minworth premises and relocated to the current site in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire in January 2001. By this stage, Ferroli had identified its key aim as being to supply the UK independents market and this remains a major focus of the company’s operations today. Driving the development of Ferroli’s range of domestic and commercial boilers and renewable energy products is the two-pronged catalyst of relentless consumer demand for better products and the need to address climate change. It’s these factors, which are at the same time both complementary and conflicting, that keep Ferroli at the leading edge of appliance design. One of Ferroli’s biggest strengths is self-sufficiency: from the initial concept through to design, manufacturing and marketing, Ferroli’s products are produced entirely in-house, with only a very small percentage of components being sourced from elsewhere. This allows for complete control over the quality, delivery and all-important aftersales aspects of all Ferroli’s products. Ferroli has brought many innovative heating appliances into the marketplace, from high efficiency domestic combi, system and open vent boilers to a wide range of renewable products, including complete solar systems, plus an extensive range of commercial boilers. In 2015 the majority share of the company was transferred to Oxy Capital Italia, based in Milan, and UK-based Attestor Capital, with the Ferroli family retaining an interest in the company."

The company is based in Dresden, Germany.FMC commercializes a disruptive material innovation that will solve this problem for current and future technology nodes, i.e. eNVM based on ferroelectric hafnium oxide (FE-HfO2). The unexpected physical effect of ferroelectricity in HfO2 allows for the transformation of classical high-k metal-gate (HKMG) transistors into nonvolatile ferroelectric field effect transistors (FeFET). In this way, MCUs can easily be scaled from e.g. 65 nm down to 28 nm and beyond enabling tremendous advantages for the overall system: SoC cost reduction of around 80%, per bit write energy reduction by a factor of 1000 and an overall performance gain of the system of around 70% due to the transition to advanced process nodes. Due to the close relation of FeFET and CMOS baseline, there is no roadblock for FMC’s technology to be applied to cutting-edge technology nodes like 22 nm FDSOI, 1X nm FinFET and beyond."

In Minas Gerais, the first institution of higher education, the School of Pharmacy in Ouro Preto, was founded in 1839. In 1875, the School of Mining was created and, in 1892, already under the Republican regime, the School of Law was established in the ancient capital of the state. In 1898, when the capital was moved to Belo Horizonte, the School of Law was moved as well. Then, in 1907, the Free School of Dentistry was created and, four years later, the Schools of Medicine and Engineering opened. In 1911, the School of Pharmacy was added to the Free School of Dentistry. A group of patriots, the ""Inconfidentes,"" who rebelled against Portuguese domination, conceived of the idea of a university in the state of Minas Gerais, which was founded as the Universidade de Minas Gerais (UMG) in 1927. The state-subsidized private institution brought together the four institutions of higher learning that existed in Belo Horizonte. UMG remained within the state system until 1949, when it was federalized. In the 1940s, a large area in the Pampulha region became the site for the construction of University City. The first structures erected were the Institute of Mechanics (now the Vocational School) and the Main Building. The effective occupation of the campus by the university community started only in the 1960s, when the construction of the buildings that today house most of the academic units was started. The present name – Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG) – was not adopted until 1965.When the university was federalized, the Schools of Architecture, Philosophy, and Economics had already been integrated into UFMG. Afterward, as part of its expansion and diversification, the university incorporated and created new units and schools: the Schools of Nursing (1950) and Veterinary Medicine (1961), the Minas Gerais Conservatory of Music (1962), and the Schools of Library (1962), Fine Arts (1963), and Physical Education (1969). In 1968, the organization of UFMG was reformed, which resulted in the division of the old School of Philosophy into various schools and institutes. Thus, the present School of Philosophy and Human Sciences, the Institutes of Biological Sciences and Exact Sciences, the Institute of Geo-Sciences, and the Schools of Letters and Education appeared. Today, firmly established as a model of excellence for the rest of the country, UFMG continues to expand. Agronomy (in Montes Claros), Drama, Control and Automation, Computational Mathematics, Audiology and Speech Pathology, and Nutrition have been added in the last five years, bringing the total of courses offered at the undergraduate level to 48."

Our mission is to provide urban women in Pakistan with functional, comfortable and trendy clothing which espouse the messages of feminism and women empowerment.  The concept behind FemTees was hatched when our founders realized that in the Pakistani t-shirt market women and feminism are severely underrepresented. This was surprising to us because women make up half of the total population of Pakistan and in the era of #MeToo, the fight for feminism, equality and women empowerment is at an all time high.  In our belief, t-shirts are highly functional pieces of clothing which a person can wear at home, for work, chores, evenings out with friends etc. In fact, in the modern day, they also have a great political utility, as graphics and messages can be printed on them. At FemTees, we make full use of these dual aspects and build our t-shirts to exclusively help women enjoy the ease and comfort of brilliantly designed t-shirts while at the same time allowing feminists to boldly wear their views on feminism, equality and women empowerment every time they step out of the house wearing one of our products. Our vision is to see an equal world in the future, where women can be free to follow their hearts and the patriarchy is smashed beneath the feet of all the brave ladies who dream of this better tomorrow with us."

If you ever tried to collect your favourite text-messages, print your holiday blog or pencil-in the birthdates of all your facebook friends into a calendar, you know what we mean. In some sense, we have lost control of our own online-content, our digital identity already. Capture your digital life Feedfabrik would like to change that. We would like to help you to capture your digital life and control your online content: the useful bits, the memories, everything that comes with it. We would like to provide you with a simple way to create something tangible from your online stuff. Something you can touch, keep: a book, a poster on the wall, whatever format does it for you. Something you can revisit - even show your friends, parents, grandparents or kids in years to come when today's internet platforms long have moved on and morphed to something new, losing bits of what makes them special today by the wayside - your own personal content. It's a big vision. It's for you."
