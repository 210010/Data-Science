Matrix,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/matrix-org,"Developer APIs, Enterprise Software, Internet of Things, Open Source, Telecommunications, VoIP","Open Source, Interoperable IP Comms","Matrix.org is an ambitious not-for-profit open source initiative defining a new open standard for decentralised, persistent and interoperable communications over the internet. Matrix.org’s aim is to fix the problem of fragmented IP-communications between devices, people and services, and make them as seamless and interoperable as possible. Matrix addresses use cases like VoIP, IoT and instant messaging but its real potential and ultimate mission is to be a generic messaging and data synchronization system for the web - allowing anyone and anything to easily communicate securely, maintaining full conversation history with no single points of control or failure. Any developer can use Matrix to easily create and host their own feature-rich real-time communication apps or add such features to an existing service whilst building on the Matrix community of users. Existing communication services can also easily join in and integrate with the Matrix ecosystem. The Matrix standard specifies simple RESTful HTTP APIs for securely transmitting and replicating JSON data between Matrix-capable clients, servers and services. Clients send data by PUTing it to a ‘room’ on their server, which then replicates the data over all the Matrix servers participating in this ‘room’. This data is signed using a blockchain-style signature to mitigate tampering, and the federated traffic is encrypted with HTTPS and signed with each server’s private key to avoid spoofing. Replication follows eventual consistency semantics, allowing servers to function even if offline or after data-loss by resynchronizing missing history from other participating servers. End-to-end encryption ensures data at rest is only readable by the room participants. The result is that data transmitted over Matrix is never stored in any single place, and is instead securely shared on a purely need-to-know basis between relevant parties, with control of access residing solely with the author.

How it works - Based on the penny auction concept MadBid.com brings gamification to shopping. There are 4 ways to shop on MadBid: 1. Bid in Auctions: Customers need to purchase credits in order to participate in the auctions. Auction winners walk away with significant discounts on branded products like Apple, Samsung and even cars. All MadBid auctions have timers that count down, an auction winner is determined when the timer runs out and no-one else places a Bid. When someone places a Bid the timer re-starts and counts down again, at which point the auction price goes up by 1p only, thus keeping the final closing price much lower than the RRP of the product.  2. Buy Now: If users do not win the auction, they can use all the spent credits in that auction as discount of the RRP of the product so they can purchase it.  3. Earned Discount: If users do not wish to pay the difference between spent credits and RRP, they can simply use the value of the spent credits in the auction to purchase any product from the Earned Discount selection. 4. Simply Click and Buy: Users do not need to participate in auctions, they can simply purchase products with a simple click and buy.   MadBid.com is part of Marcandi Ltd."

Doctors today spend hours during Endoscopic Procedures looking at the LCD screens in order to explore, examine and treat various conditions. At Magentiq Eye we put the growing power of Deep Learning, Image and Video Processing to the help of doctors, so they can be more accurate and effective- ultimately saving millions of lives and billions of dollars. Our first product is APDS: Automatic Polyp Detection System, developed to be used in online and offline colonoscopies.  Our APDS (Automatic Polyp Detection System) can point out the suspicious locations of polyps in the videos, increasing the attentiveness of doctors during procedures, thus helping them to reduce their polyp miss-rates. Given the large population that annually undergoes colonoscopy, even a modest decrease in polyp miss-rate can save a lot of lives! The APDS- RT runs on the video feed from the endoscopic camera used by the physician in real time during the endoscopic procedure (currently only on Colonoscopy Procedure). The APDS-OFL is a software that runs in off-line mode on pre-Recorded Colonoscopy Videos.   It is estimated that 40 million colonoscopy procedures are performed every year (almost 40% in the US alone). The ability of colonoscopy procedures to decrease the number of colon cancer cases has been proven without a doubt and their number expected to grow. However, researches have shown that there is about 25% of misses (undetected polyps) in those procedures, misses which can, unfortunately, cause interval cancer. Within this context The APDS can be sold as an add-on to the colonoscopy system or as a service (license per exam), paid by the clinic or hospital.  Once the APDS system would be formally proven, during the next year, to improve polyp detection rate, it could be sold either jointly with the endoscopic equipment providers or it can be integrated in the colonoscopy devices."

Marinanow solves this problem by using proven business models from the hotel and home rental industry.  It offers the ability to book online, automatically from any port in the world using one site (a similar concept to sites like hotels.com).  It also allows the “subleasing” of berths that have long term bookings (a similar concept to airbnb). The team is made up of four partners who have a vast experience in the marina industry as well as programming, internet companies and Startups.  They have been accepted into an incubator and raised money from an accelerator programme and are now looking for angels to coinvest with United Ventures, an Italian VC firm. The site and mobile apps are online and fully functional and last summer, the team invested a small amount in marketing to test the product.  The test was a huge success with a return of initial investment of around 2000%.   They are now looking to raise further money to build on this initial success and expand aggressively to become the dominant player."

Each custom routine can easily be calibrated from one body size to another to allow people to share Massages with friends and celebrities through our social networking application.  Customer Problem: The fact is that all people have pain and stress at some point in life. Massage therapy is expensive and typically reserved for luxury.  Not all masseurs are created equal, which leads to some bad massages and even injury. Not all masseurs are moral and ethical, which has led to a shady reputation for the whole industry. Massage Chairs have a limited number of motions and routines pre-programmed in the factory.  Products/Services: Alex has two 6-axis high precision series-elastic industrial robotic arms that meet collaborative safety regulations for operating with humans. Attachments are designed with an open architecture to promote third-party accessory development. Alex is connected to the Internet through a HIPPA network. Services are provided in salon stores with 2 to 6 private massage pod rooms. Single massage pods can be operated as franchises from airports and shopping malls.  Target Market: The $12 billion massage industry is the primary market, but as the technology of smart-phones greatly expanded the wireless telecommunications market, robots will expand massage and physical therapy into the much larger $1 trillion wellness industry. Alex will be found in healthcare operations, business organizations, government agencies, and military bases.  Customers: The primary persona that Alex will serve is Joe the Plumber as personified in the 2008 presidential campaign. Everyday Joe works hard, stretches every dollar and usually only takes 5 days of vacation to a place he can drive to with his family. He values wellness for his family but does have time after a long hot day on the job to go to the gym. Joe is a church-going man and has three daughters who he cherishes. He is a private conservative person and generally doesn’t like to chit-chat at the barber's chair.  Sales/Marketing Strategy: Company stores located in strip malls will have typical grand openings coupled with an awareness marketing campaign generally used for new restaurants and commercial outlets in local communities. Direct sales by company salespeople will focus on nationwide and global organizations such as hotel chains, fitness facilities, airlines and cruise liners. Massage chair distribution companies will be the primary channel for private sales. National talk shows will be solicited for the launch of this new technology. The Today Show and Ellen will be a home run. National TV advertising will be used for awareness after we have traction in 20% of the states.  Business Model: Two business models will provide recurring and top-line revenue. 1,000 Company-owned stores will provide subscription-based services to approximately 1,500 users per store. Subscriptions will be $60 per month for one Massage per week. This will produce $1 billion in recurring annual revenue.  Direct sales of 5,000 units per year at $75,000 per unit will yield $375 million in top-line revenue at a 40% gross margin.  Competitors: Our primary direct competitor is Massage Envy that started with one store in 2002 and quickly grew to 1,000 stores having 25,000 employees, 1.65 million subscribers and over $1 billion in annual revenue. Inada and Fujiiryoki are the leaders in the massage chair market. Indirectly, there is definitely competition for human vs robotic massage. Just like digital photography far surpassed film and wireless phones have displaced the analog home phone, robotics will definitely become integrated into our lives for our benefit and be a significant part of our overall wellness programs. Competitive Advantage: Robotics reduces the barriers that prevent Joe the Plumber from making massage a significant part of his wellness program. For the same monthly subscription price, users get 2 to 4 times the massage time. Alex is androgynous, so Joe does not need to choose between a man or woman masseuse. Joe’s wife does not need to worry about sexual conduct when he goes for a robotic massage. He doesn’t need to be embarrassed by his body image, nor does he need to be concerned at work of his reputation when he goes to a robotic massage parlor.  Joe can go directly from a hot day at work to see Alex without taking a shower and he doesn’t have to make considerate small talk with a robot. Robots also eliminate more than 80% of the staff needed to operate a massage salon. Massage Envy averages 25 human resources per store. With only one person needed to operate a robotic salon, 3 to 5 people can easily cover multiple shifts, holidays and sick time. By eliminating the manual work effort of a masseuse, the company eliminates workman compensation claims. Robots facilitate nearly impossible precision, which translates into the number one factor in successful chain store operations--repeatability and a consistent experience for customers at any store.

Magnomics,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/magnomics,"Health Diagnostics, Medical Device, Veterinary","Magnomics is a medical technology company committed to delivering a new generation of rapid, portable molecular diagnostic tests.","Overview: Magnomics is a diagnostics, medical technology company committed to delivering a new generation of rapid, portable molecular diagnostic tests with applications in the human health, veterinary, and food industry markets. Affordable, disposable diagnostic cartridges will be produced in large scale and shipped via global distributors. The team behind the company has world class experience in biotechnology, electronics and physics, with a proven track record in managing start-ups. Magnomics has a Letter of Intent from a leading dairy company and won the 2015 Kansas City Animal Health Investment Forum innovation award, as well as the Ag Biotech Entrepreneurial Showcase award in North Carolina in 2016. €1.6M in seed financing have been raised through grants and investments. Magnomics is seeking €1.5M to conclude the prototyping of its first product in the animal health space.  Technology: Magnomics technology stands on four patent families, with more in the pipeline, and has been published over twenty times in prestigious scientific journals. Magnomics provides a portable and affordable PCR device that requires no training to operate. The product integrates sample preparation, amplification and DNA detection within a single cartridge using microfluidics, making use of a novel magnetoresistive DNA sensing technology.  Market: The veterinary diagnostics market is hungry for innovation and has low regulatory barriers. This market is estimated at €4 billion, with an 8.6% expected growth for the period 2016 to 2021. Magnomics will focus on the detection of bovine mastitis - an inflammation of the dairy cow’s mammary gland, whose treatment depends on the bacteria involved. This ailment causes over €30 billion in annual losses for producers worldwide. In the initial target markets (North America, Europe and Brazil), there are 56 million dairy cows with an average mastitis base incidence 30%. Given a €25 price tag and some segmentation, this amounts to a serviceable market of close to €300M, in which a penetration of 10-15% is expectable. The product can be sold either directly to farmers or to veterinarians: strategic partnerships are being negotiated with large pharma/dairy players to ensure market access. Competition: Companies such as AAD, DeLaval, and PortaCheck already have on-site solutions, which include California Mastitis Tests (CMT), Somatic Cell Counters and variants (SCC), as well as lateral flow strips. These current on-site diagnostics tools indicate the presence of an infection but are unable to determine the pathogen, which is key to define an appropriate treatment. Culture testing (e.g. Idexx, Virbac) is the current benchmark and is being tried on site as well: although cheap, the added value is greatly diminished due to long waiting times and difficulties in setting up a working protocol. Finally, laboratories provide fast molecular solutions (e.g. ThermoFisher) that are fast but expensive, while requiring complicated logistics due to sample collection that increase lead times. Magnomics will bring these molecular solutions to the farm in a convenient and affordable product. "

Established in the same year, MSC Malaysia’s primary focus was to create an ideal and conducive platform to nurture Malaysian Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the ICT sector, to become world-class businesses whilst attracting participation from global ICT companies to invest in and develop cutting edge digital and creative solutions in Malaysia. Seventeen years on, MSC Malaysia has driven the development of the Malaysian ICT industry, enhanced technology adoption, and has made significant strides in increasing the economic impact and footprint of ICT for the nation.  There are powerful economic and fiscal incentives for companies, both local and international, to apply for MSC status. Just as importantly, Malaysia has passed a number of effective new laws, which protect intellectual property and ensure freedom of thought and expression.  This remarkable initiative has positioned Malaysia as a preferred ICT investment hub. Today, there are over 3,000 MSC Malaysia Status companies, employing over 140,000 people, these include: 373 companies in the Creative Multimedia Cluster, 115 Institutions of Higher Learning and Incubators, 2,392 Information Technology companies and over 280 Shared Services & Outsourcing providers.  In 2012, MSC Malaysia revenue came in at RM 33.53 billion which was an increase of 5.7% from 2011, while exports grew to RM 11.6 billion which reflected a 14% rise from the previous year. This resulted in MSC Malaysia’s contribution to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) standing at 11.3 billion, recording a significant double digit growth of 18% from 2011.  In October 2010, MDeC was given an additional task by the government, which was to develop a blueprint for a Digital Economy that draws from the huge opportunities created by the Digital world.  This resulted in a programme called Digital Malaysia that was officially unveiled to the public in May 2012.  Digital Malaysia is a natural progression to harness the building blocks already laid by MSC Malaysia. Founded on three strategic thrusts, of moving Malaysia from supply to demand, consumption to production and low knowledge-add to high knowledge-add, it ultimately aims to create an ecosystem that promotes the pervasive use of ICT in all aspects of the economy and the first eight projects are already under implementation.  This will in turn connect communities globally and enable them to interact in real time, increase the country’s Gross National Income, enhance business productivity and improve the standards of living.. Ultimately, Digital Malaysia aims to turn Malaysia into a developed digital economy by 2020, that connects and empowers the government, businesses and citizens. Today, both MSC Malaysia and Digital Malaysia run concurrently to spur Malaysia’s ICT industry development and digital economic growth, under the purview of MDeC."
