The company has developed two types of human immunoglobulin gene transgenic mice: mice that generate “conventional” tetrameric antibodies comprising two heavy and two light immunoglobulin chains (H2L2); and alternatively, mice that generate heavy chain only antibodies comprising two immunoglobulin heavy chains with no light chains (HCAbs). Availability of HCAbs facilitates the generation of soluble human VH domains (human heavy chain variable region domains), the minimal immunoglobulin recognition unit, and thus the construction of novel multi-functional molecules comprising either two (or more) VH domains or one VH domain coupled to other molecules. Both Harbour transgenic mouse lines are now available to licensing partners."

Hairpal is making that possible and moreover insuring that it’s an awesome experience. We make sure employees know when the hairdresser is at the office and can book and pay absolutely frictionless. More importantly, we insure the hairdressers are highly skilled and customer minded, while constantly educating them based on feedback. This solution is great - because it is a great deal for the hairdressers as well. We interviewed a lot of those too. They hated the late hours, because many had small kids. But they are necessary, because the mid-day bookings are few. And if they want to be self employed and start their own salon, the costs are sky high. Therefore, the concept of “renting a chair” has become increasingly popular, however, the hairdressers high fixed costs, plus variable costs, AND have to secure their own customers.  What we offer is no fixed costs, flexibility, a customer base, regular working hours. In other words, we reduce the stress and give hairdressers the opportunity to earn more.  "
