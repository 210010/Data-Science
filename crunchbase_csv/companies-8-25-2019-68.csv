The barges are former military or construction ships with a 40 to 50 year extended life that are in robust working condition and meet all Coast Guard certifications. Nautilus’ first barge is currently under construction at California’s Mare Island where Nautilus has successfully validated its first proof of concept prototype data center. The proof of concept went through a certified third party data center pre-commissioning process and was validated by the engineering firms – Jacobs Engineering and Critical Engineering Group.  Since it is five times more efficient to cool using water versus moving air, Nautilus’ patented cooling technology leverages the natural water that the barge safely rests on and allows the company to offer customers a high-density computing data center environment. Specifically, the waterborne data center can be configured and operated with up to 800 server racks deployed in less than six months anywhere around the world. Nautilus’ cloud solution automates the infrastructure in an open source environment agnostic to any data center, cloud or application. Additionally, Nautilus’ DCIM solution is predictive with integrated artificial intelligence that self heals and provides military-grade security. The Nautilus approach competes directly against the traditional or conventional data center approach by reducing the build time from two years to only six months. The green data center build by Nautilus has 19,000 tons of lower emissions (equivalent to approximately 3600 cars) as compared to the conventional data center. With a potential 50% annual energy savings, the Nautilus design could save clients up to $4 million in energy use cost. All of this is supported with our Patent- pending technology specific to Data Center Vessel, Modularity, Cooling System and Thermal Containment, Intelligent Power Management and DCIM with Predictive Analytics."

Known for its passionate fan base, one-of-a-kind playoff format (Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup), development of the modern sports sponsorship and commitment to enhancing auto racing through technology, NASCAR produces many of the most highly attended sporting events in the world. NASCAR did not gain the success or popularity it has today overnight. The sport has evolved to entertain its fans and continuously prosper. In 2003, NASCAR made two major announcements to help the dawn of the new era become even clearer. NASCAR announced in June that Nextel would become the new series sponsor in 2004, replacing R.J. Reynolds' Winston brand after 33 years. Three months later in September, Brian Z. France was named as NASCAR's CEO and Chairman of the Board replacing his father, Bill France. A steady parade of changes has followed. The Chase for the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup was announced at the start of 2004, ushering in a new format to determine the champion of NASCAR's premier series. In 2006, Toyota announced a move into all three of NASCAR's national series. In 2007 it was announced that the premier series' name would be changed to the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series beginning in 2008. In addition, Nationwide Insurance was announced as the replacement for Anheuser-Busch as main sponsor of NASCAR's series born from Late Models in 1982. The 2007 season also marked the beginning of NASCAR's new car in premier series competition, a car designed to be safer than ever while also reducing costs to compete -- all the while enhancing the racing itself. The new car could not slow down Jimmie Johnson who captured a record five consecutive championships from 2006-2010, becoming only the second driver to win three consecutive titles (Cale Yarborough 1976-1978). During the late 2000s, NASCAR began further expanding by creating series internationally. The NASCAR Canadian Tire Series and the NASCAR Toyota Series (Mexico) launched their inaugural seasons in 2007. The sanctioning body extended its reach across the Atlantic when it founded the NASCAR Whelen Euro Series in 2012. Today, NASCAR runs three national series, four regional series, one local grassroots series and three international series. In 2013, NASCAR continued enhance its racing, debuting its Gen-6 car that enhanced body designs to better resemble the cars found in showrooms across the United States and improve on-track performance. NASCAR also secured its television rights through 2024 by agreeing to a 10-year rights deal with NBC Universal and an eight-year rights extension with FOX. To emphasize winning races, NASCAR created a new Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup playoff format for 2014 and unveiled its new grid format for advancing drivers."

President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1958, partially in response to the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial satellite the previous year. NASA grew out of the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA), which had been researching flight technology for more than 40 years. President John F. Kennedy focused NASA and the nation on sending astronauts to the moon by the end of the 1960s. Through the Mercury and Gemini projects, NASA developed the technology and skills it needed for the journey. On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first of 12 men to walk on the moon, meeting Kennedy's challenge. Meanwhile, NASA was continuing the aeronautics research pioneered by NACA. It also conducted purely scientific research and worked on developing applications for space technology, combining both pursuits in developing the first weather and communications satellites. After Apollo, NASA focused on creating a reusable ship to provide regular access to space: the space shuttle. First launched in 1981, the space shuttle flew more than 130 successful flights before retiring in 2011. In 2000, the United States and Russia established permanent human presence in space aboard the International Space Station, a multinational project representing the work of 16 nations. NASA also has continued its scientific research. In 1997, Mars Pathfinder became the first in a fleet of spacecraft that will explore Mars in the next decade, as we try to determine if life ever existed there. The Terra and Aqua satellites are flagships of a different fleet, this one in Earth orbit, designed to help us understand how our home world is changing.

Each of these technologies has its pros and cons. Postal addresses have different formats in different countries, many places don't have postal addresses or are too large for a single address (stadiums, parks, shopping malls). They are also very long, difficult in writing and are hard to pronounce even in native language. Geocoordinates are more precise and convenient. You can assign a geotag to any place on Earth, but you can't use it as an address. It's difficult to write down and almost impossible to communicate by voice. Naviaddress combines advantages of both technologies and nullifies their flaws. It is both an address and a geotag. You don't have to specify country, region, city, street, latitude or longitude. It is all encoded in the naviaddress. And naviaddress is very easy to remember because it consists of the numbers you already know - country and region phone code, house and index numbers. In the near future naviaddress will be used not only to get to places, but to receive post and shipments. Each naviaddress is also a web page.

Our patented technology utilizes a novel approach to transthoracically deliver low electrical cardioversion and/or drugs directly to targeted atrial heart tissue. The system is cost efficient and offers an effective and precise treatment solution without the severe side effects often associated with current treatment options. 2.	Product / Solution Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is the most frequent complication after cardiac surgery, occurring within 20% - 60% of patients. In addition, the incidence of POAF seems to be increasing in the post-operative setting for various reasons, an aging population being the most significant reason. POAF is a serious concern because of the numerous potential negative outcomes, which include: an increased risk for re-intubation, heart failure, stroke, ventricular arrhythmias, and death. Despite recent improvements in medical and surgical techniques related to cardiac surgery, POAF remains a major complication that is responsible for increased hospital stays and increased hospital costs.  The current treatment regimens for POAF, a combination of intravenous (IV) antiarrhythmic drugs and external electrocardioversion, are in general successful in restoring sinus rhythm. However, there are a number of serious side effects and drawbacks inherent to these treatments. The various antiarrhythmic  drugs used for the management of POAF include amiodarone and sotalol. These drugs are administered intravenously (IV) and have serious systemic side effects because of the high drug concentrations needed to raise blood levels high enough to achieve a therapeutic level that will affect the atrial tissue. On the other hand, external electrocardioversion subjects the patient to a large amount of electric energy (100 -360 joules), which can cause severe discomfort and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Electrocardioversion must be performed under general anesthesia by a team of highly specialized medical personnel.  The complications associated with administering antiarrhythmic drugs and external electrocardioversion has prompted many investigators to pursue new techniques in order to eliminate these complications. The current medical literature supports local antiarrhythmic drug delivery to the heart. This type of delivery has been shown to restore sinus rhythm or prevent AF using much lower drug doses (10 to 100 times less) than the current standard practices. This, in turn, may alleviate or remove the unwanted systemic side effects associated with these drugs. In addition, it has been shown that internal low energy electrocardioversion can be very successful in restoring sinus rhythm using almost 100 times less energy than the current external electrocardioversion process. This eliminates the need for sedation, anesthesiologists, and lessens the pain felt by the patient. Unlike what is currently available on the market or in the medical literature, the design of the Native Cardiovascular device CVS001 (electrocardioversion only) and CVS002 (electrocardioversion and drug administration) is intended to address the complications associated with POAF.  The Native Cardiovascular devices (CVS001 or CVS002), using standard surgical procedures, are implanted prior to closure of coronary  surgery. Pads held together by a proprietary lead design are placed on the atrial heart surfaces. Once in place, CVS001/002 allows targeted tissue delivery of medication and/or low-voltage electric shock. Prior to patient discharge, the CVS001/002 is removed postoperatively without the need for secondary surgery. Email gdixon@native-cardio.com for a full Information Memorandum and/or slide deck."

National Indemnity Company,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/national-indemnity-company-2,"Financial Services, Insurance",National Indemnity Company is the lead member of the National Indemnity group of insurance companies.,"The story begins in 1940 with two entrepreneurial brothers and a two room office in Omaha, Nebraska. Arthur and Jack Ringwalt founded National Indemnity Company as a specialty insurance firm, a four employee operation (including President Jack Ringwalt) that wrote liability insurance on taxis. Their payroll and Their scope of service has blossomed since then, but They still adhere to the Ringwalts’ founding principles: that there is a proper rate for every legitimate risk and that such “risky” classes as long-haul trucks, taxis, rental cars, and public buses should not be arbitrarily rejected. National Indemnity Company is, today, one of the leading property/casualty members of the Berkshire Hathaway group of insurance companies. Stock control changed from founder Jack Ringwalt to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in March of 1967. In the 2004 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report, Warren E. Buffett, Chairman, wrote, “Indeed, had They not made this acquisition [National Indemnity Company], Berkshire would be lucky to be worth half of what it is today.” In addition to its insurance operations, Berkshire Hathaway also has holdings in retail stores, newspapers, and other businesses. In 1985, National Indemnity Company evolved further, launching its Specialty Risk Division (now known as Professional Liability & Specialty Risks Division). An ad, placed in the Business Insurance, featured the headline, “Berkshire Hathaway wants to see property/casualty risks where the premium is $1,000,000 or more.” This operation began in the Omaha office and eventually moved to Connecticut with the company’s reinsurance division. The National Indemnity group of insurance companies has traditionally conducted its non-reinsurance business nationwide relying on a network of more than 100 contracted general agents. Independent (or “producing”) agents strive to understand and address their customers’ needs, often relying on the markets provided by general agents to place such business. They contract with the general agents to manage business relationships with those local producing agents. This wholesale distribution arrangement allows Their commercial insurance products to be effectively available across the country. A rich history. A promising future. They’ve experienced dramatic change since 1940, and They're proud of that. But, They're also proud of that which has remained constant: Their presence in Omaha, Nebraska, and Their unwavering commitment to protecting Their customers with strength, stability and integrity."

Nau International Inc,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nau-international-inc,Fashion,"Nau (pronounced ""now"") is a clothing company based in Portland, Oregon. We make sustainable urban+outdoor apparel.","Nau (pronounced ""now"") is a clothing company based in Portland, Oregon. We make sustainable urban+outdoor apparel. All aspects of our business - from the product to the business model - are an extension of who we are and how we live. We design for ourselves, first. If we won't wear it, why should you. The same goes for business: if we can't stand behind the decisions we make, why should you. So, in that sense, we're a little self-absorbed. We're a small team - less than twenty of us, for now. We spend a lot of time together, always talking, testing things out, sketching, pinning things up, asking, heckling, critiquing, revising. It usually gets too loud.   We work hard. We play hard. We like to go outside. A lot of us ride bikes. We also ski, snowboard, climb, surf, run, make music, see music, take pictures, grow food, eat food, stay out late, have families, and have dogs who clack around and sleep at our feet. Collectively, we go through a lot of prosecco, dark chocolate, and beer. And we keep coming back to our Portland office, early in the mornings, until pretty late at night, because we're stuck on an idea: to redesign fashion and to redefine business so that each become a powerful force for change. One small step towards unfucking the world. Our goal has been the same since the beginning-to use design to redefine business so that it can be a positive force for change. We do this the only way we know how: by making sustainability and philanthropy inherent in everything we do, from thoughtful, considered designs to giving back 2% of every sale to one of our Partners for Change. It's an integrated approach which blends the tailored and the technical to craft beautiful, urban and outdoor apparel for the modern, mobile lifestyle. This means classic designs, timeless colors, and premium, eco-friendly fabrics. It means challenging assumptions to design beyond trends to create style that will live long after the season is over. No logos. No fleeting hues. Just simple, clean, well-crafted silhouettes built to move with the elements, but still look sleek in the city. It's a different way of doing things. One that requires a shift in the way an industry does business. One that we're not afraid to stand behind. One that gives a damn-and is doing something about it."
