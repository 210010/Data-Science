In Thailand, online stores are still striving to have a proper payment solution because applying and implementing has never been simple and smooth. All of the major PSP’s require cumbersome documentation to apply; monthly commitments, high transaction fees and all take considerable amount of time to gain approval.

This fraud may occur by shoppers’ photo shopping their proof of payment. Since a reliable, simple and smooth online payment system has been lacking in Thailand, Omise.co founder, Jun Hasegawa and co-founder Ezra Don Harinsut, recognized the need to bridge the gap between stores and shoppers.

In our office, spread over four floors in the heart of Berlin, there is a dynamic atmosphere that uses many of the working methods inherited from Silicon Valley. We work fast and innovatively, draw consistent conclusions from our daily product improvements and work very close to the customer. We do not believe in a general rule Omnea sees itself as a technology service provider. We invested heavily to build and maintain the best connection from our customers to the most relevant Internet portals and directories. In particular, the best connection means: reliable, direct interfaces from Omnea directly into the databases of directory providers. In well over half of all Internet portals, software and apps that we control, the data is synchronized via API interfaces and kept up to date - in real time, almost immediately. However, anyone who relies on technology without personal service in an ever-growing and rapidly evolving directory landscape will be pushed to the limits of product quality time and time again. What happens if a company with thousands of locations suddenly fails a series of electronic data transmission methods, because there is an update or technical problem with the often international Internet portals? They trust us that even in such a case, a consistent, complete presence is permanently guaranteed for you. We have therefore also built up a powerful unit for ongoing presence management and customer support for you. Our employees in this area not only help out where advice and support are needed, but also take care of various aspects, that can not be mastered with static technology alone. Only the combination of modern technology, active support engineers and consultants turns the confusing online directory landscape into a portfolio of reach-strong channels. This can efficiently control our customers through a single point of contact - Omnea."

Omega Brandess,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/omega-brandess,Photography,OmegaBrandess has manufactured and distributed photographic and imaging products for over 75 years. ,"The history of OmegaBrandess starts all the way back in 1935 when three brothers, Fred, Rudolph, and Alfred Simmon produced a domestic enlarger for the 35mm camera format. In 1936, they chose the Greek letter 'Omega' as their trademark and registered it with the US Patent Office. Over the years, they adapted to the market and came out with several different enlargers. During World War II, civilian use of enlargers was prohibited. The trio secured contracts with the Army Signal Corps and the US Navy, and they were commissioned to make enlargers and film pack cameras to meet the Navy requirements for combat conditions. After the war ended, they resumed their production of consumer enlargers. By the mid-1950s, the brothers had made the decision to become a division of Berkey Photo so that their legacy may live on. With the introduction of color head enlargers that allowed photographers to produce their own enlargements, Omega introduced a number of new models in the 70s and 80s. With the introduction of one hour photo labs, point-and-shoot 35 mm cameras and digital cameras, the darkroom market began to plummet. In the late 1980s, Berkey Photo went bankrupt. The assets of the Omega enlarger division of Berkey were purchased in 1988 by the RT Color Corp., and was renamed Omega International. Not long after, that company also entered bankruptcy. In May of 1990, the assets of the now bankrupt Omega International were purchased by a small group of Baltimore-based investors under the name Omega Acquisition Corporation.       "
