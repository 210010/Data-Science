Kitchensurfing,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kitchensurfing,"Food and Beverage, Hospitality, Marketplace",Kitchensurfing enables people to eat together and to eat purposefully by sending private chefs into their home kitchens.,"Kitchensurfing is an on-demand service for people who love food. It is re-defining the dining experience by directly connecting chefs to diners, and in the process, creating a more intimate and rewarding experience for everyone around the table.  There’s a monumental shift that has taken place in the home – and more specifically at the dinner table – in the last 50 years. The modern household has begun to evolve as a two-income home, and finding time to whip up a home-cooked meal is becoming nearly impossible. Even where the institution does still exist, traditional dinner conversation is losing out in the battle against our phones, tablets and television screens. The reality is that the family and community experience associated with sitting down at the dinner table is quickly becoming an ideal of the past. Kitchensurfing aims to change all of that. By empowering people to eat together and eat purposefully, its mission is to reinstate the idea of the “dinner table” for the modern household.  Enter: Kitchensurfing Tonight. In a modern world starved for time, the problem of dinner is everyone’s, and Kitchensurfing Tonight is reinventing the dining experience through ease and convenience. For $25 per person, it allows busy couples and families to enjoy the experience of a freshly prepared dinner (in under 30 minutes), from a personal chef they know and trust, in the comfort of their own homes. And at a very competitive price, Kitchensurfing Tonight is the perfect alternative to takeout, for busy families who want to dine together (on plates, not out of boxes) around the table, with a meal that’s delicious and good for them, too.  With four different product offerings, Kitchensurfing has any experience covered. Customers can book a chef same-day for a quick, hassle-free 30-minute meal on a Tuesday night; host a fancy cocktail party for 30 with an in-home, person chef; or plan a fun, interactive cooking experience with a group friends and family. Kitchensurfing sources sustainable and locally-grown ingredients that chefs use to create restaurant-caliber dishes in the comfort of one’s own home, whatever the occasion."

In a world dominated by cookie-cutter clones the evil forces of McFashion spread it’s awful agenda throughout the universe. The masses lived in a dark and bland world of predictability and boredom. The culture had been contaminated and Individual style was nonexistent. This was not to stand in the year of our ‘Loop 2000, a beacon of hope flashed from the Northeast guided by an intrepid entrepreneur and his rebel alliance of culturists who rose to battle the evil forces of McFashion. They set out to create a lifestyle brand...something that was more than just an e-commerce site but also a community of style and a full-fledged media powerhouse! The leader who emerged was Greg Selkoe and his rebel army was to be known throughout the universes as Karmaloop. And with your help as well as that from reinforcements worldwide over the past decade, the rebels have beat back the clones and McFashion’s empire has been crumbling under the weight of individuality ever since! It started, like many revolutions, in the underground. A basement to be more specific - Greg’s parents basement to be exact. While hundreds upon thousands of dot.com ventures began to disintegrate, Karmaloop ignored doubts, attacks and negativity (“The Internet?! Ha! You'll never make money off the Internet!”) after that moving operations to a dilapidated piano factory run by a lunatic landlord... and subsequently chasing out crackheads busting in the office, grinding for low or no money while working other “day jobs,” dealing with floods, theft, and fraudsters, engaging in drinking binges and making numerous trips to New York on the Fung Wah Bus aka “the Chicken Run”. All of it to get the gear you really wanted into your closet and concrete culture into your mind. Yet through it all Karmaloop never lost faith for one good reason...cause you had their back. Against all odds, the rebels weathered the battles and became true dot.com survivors. They have moved a couple times since (more crazy landlords, however) and now employ roughly 130 20 and 30-somethings that run Karmaloop in offices in Boston, NY, and LA. They don’t just work for Karmaloop, they live the culture, and it is with that dedication and loyalty (and of course the best customers in the world) that the site has grown into the cultural force Karmaloop is today. Karmaloop consists of: Karmaloop.com with over 300 clothing brands for Guys and Ladies, Karmaloop Kazbah Karmaloop’s market place for select up and coming brands, Karmaloop contests, Karmaloop blogs, Karmaloop music, Karmaloop Look Books, Karmaloop Rep Program, PLNDR.com a private flash sale site, KarmaloopTV.com, Buyer Wire Klickable Video, and coming later in 2011 Boylston Trading Co. exclusive street fashion and custom collabs, and KARMALOOP TV Multi-Platform the first cable channel for Verge Culture.... Celebrating the convergence of underground fashion, music, art, and entertainment! Without the incredible support from their family, friends and partners Karmaloop simply would not exist. But once again the most important key to Karmaloop’s existence is you, the customers and viewers, that has never doubted, spread the word and showed patience. When there were screw ups you understood and you gave love when things were done well - for this the Karmaloop fam will be eternally grateful! Karmaloop pledges to keep killing shit from now until eternity! If you ever need the CEO, Founder, and Owner Greg Selkoe this is his cell phone # 617-216-1013 and this is his email ges@karmaloop.com.

Their KYnergy technology uses the textile Celliant to recycle the body's waste energy back for the benefit of the wearer, to enhance performance and accelerate recovery processes. They designed and engineered their specialist sportswear to work harder for you, so you can perform at your MAXIMUM potential. KYMIRA Sport products have been designed specifically with the purpose of enhancing performance and accelerating recovery. With their inbuilt KYnergy infrared technology embedded within the fibres of their fabrics, your body gains from the following responses that occur when you are exposed to infrared. click on the PROVEN benefits below to find out exactly how the magic happens! Using their KYnergy infrared technology causes an increase in a molecule called Nitric Oxide (NO) which is a vasodilator. This means that NO causes your blood vessels to expand, allowing more blood to pass through them  Putting it simply, using their KYnergy infrared technology means that your muscles have more fuel available and work more efficiently. Breaking this down, because your circulation is increased, more oxygen is delivered to the muscle cells (more fuel).   There isn't a simple way to explain this, but in short: when you use KYMIRA kit, the infrared causes NO to dissociate from the active site of one of the enzyme Cytochrome-C Oxidase which is part of the energy production process within your cells. Because the active site is free, the metabolic processes within your cells occur quicker resulting in a number of further responses: increased energy (ATP) production and cells grow, repair & replicate quicker. Finally studies have found that using their technology will alleviate pain because as well as acting as a vasodilator, NO also reacts with a molecule called cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate (cGMP) which then mediates a pain relief response. The NO & cGMP reaction is actually the same way that taking an opiate like morphine works, but infrared is a lot less potent."
