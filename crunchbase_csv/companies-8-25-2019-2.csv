When Aedren was one, Alysia had a moment of realization – two overpriced electronic toys, that were advertised as being “smart”, were simultaneously calling for Aedren’s attention in the loudest, most repetitive manner possible. Yet, Aedren was content playing with her wooden blocks a few feet away. Based on her experiences at Carnegie Mellon University, Alysia knew there were more inventive ways to use technology. She started noticing that many tech toys weren’t built with children’s development in mind – they simply aimed to distract children, not entertain or enrich them. That night, Alysia couldn’t sleep. Her mind was whirling with ideas for how to use technology to encourage children to play with more creative, hands-on activities. She took those ideas to her design professor and created an independent study to explore the possibilities. Niko worked with Alysia to expand her ideas and create visuals and prototypes. After getting an extremely positive reception from parents, kids, peers, and even investors, Alysia and Niko decided to continue their work as a formal company. Since their daughter was the inspiration, they named the company after her: AE Dreams. Shortly after joining Project Olympus, a CMU incubator, they pitched Turtle Mail to a Pittsburgh hardware accelerator. Through these resources they received seed funding and mentorship to flesh out their business and manufacturing plans. They built a team, recruiting from CMU’s talent, with backgrounds in design, engineering, child psychology, business, and marketing. Many team members are parents, and each member joined the project because they believed in the vision of using technology to make kids’ playtime more meaningful and magical. Turtle Mail is a wooden mailbox for kids that receives and prints digital content using an embedded thermal printer. Turtle Mail is WiFi-connected, so family and friends can send kids messages from a mobile or desktop device, and kids get their mail printed out each day from Turtle Mail. Parents can sign their children up for daily activities from AE Dreams, like word searches and drawing exercises. Parents can also help their kids connect to their imaginary worlds by subscribing to content from fictional characters and by building toy profiles for their kids’ favorite toys. Just set up your preferences and we’ll do the rest! Turtle Mail’s content adjusts based on children’s age and reading level, and children’s preferences can be modified at any time by their parents."

Aengevelt,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/aengevelt,"Property Management, Real Estate",Largest private real estate firm in Germany.,"AENGEVELT approaches its centenary – meaning almost 100 years of real estate innovation The business was founded on 1 April 1910 by Leo Aengevelt. His son, Willi Aengevelt, joined the Company on 1 April 1928 and assumed its management in 1936 at the age of 24. His sons, Dr Lutz and Dr Wulff Aengevelt, joined in 1965 and 1969 respectively, forming the third genenration of the business. In 1969, the sole-trader enterprise was converted into a partnership legal entity with the name AENGEVELT Immobilien KG and then converted to AENGEVELT Immobilien GmbH & Co. KG in 2003. In the turbulent times that have made up the company’s 90-year history, its guiding principles have always been innovation and its positioning at the forefront of real estate developments.  After 1945, for example, AENGEVELT engaged with great success in the key matters of urban planning, changes of use and shaping city landscapes, particularly in Düsseldorf, which was faced with major space management issues. One of these issues was concerted collaboration in the re-design of Düsseldorf city centre from 1947 onwards, including the Königsallee boulevard, the widening of main city centre thoroughfares such as Schadowstraße, Immermannstraße and Corneliusstraße, the repositioning of the ""Tucht-Insel"" with Hochstraße and Berliner Allee and also the relocation and settlement of companies engaged in industry and commerce. In 1955 Willi Aengevelt built its former head office on a previous bomb site at what was then Alleestraße 35, today Heinrich-Heine-Allee 35. At the end of the 1960s, AENGEVELT initiated the German version of business parks and in the 1970s designed property-related methodologies for dealing with fallow and underused industrial and commercial land, developing early settlement procedures and starting to deal with contamination, demolition and infrastructure connection management as well as project planning and development. At this time, the company also produced the first commercial rent indices, purchase price indices and return-on-investment indices – an absolute industry first – which have been updated and published on a continuous basis ever since. Another industry innovation which started at the beginning of the 1980s was the ongoing production of representative purchase price indices for detached, semi-detached and three-family dwellings and apartments as well as ROI indices for residential, office and retail properties in and around Düsseldorf in collaboration with the University of Cologne Institute for Housing Law and Housing Economics. Another fine example is the private-sector-only commercial land and infrastructure development methodology developed in 1979. As part of this strategy, which completely excluded public funding, AENGEVELT also designed the necessary associated real estate tools for land preparation, decontamination and demolition management as well as project planning right through to complex project development work, successfully implementing the procedure as a pilot project on two sites owned by Langenfeld Town Council, between Düsseldorf and Cologne. This resulted in a total of approximately 731,000 m² of land being placed, as well as the creation of around 2,000 jobs in 85 businesses. In 1983 the public/private partnership procedure known since then as the ""Langenfeld model"" was praised in the first National Building Land report as the only financing model for the private sector opening-up of land held in private or public sector ownership.  In order to acknowledge the growing internationalisation of the real estate market, AENGEVELT joined the ICPA (International Commercial Property Associates) – now known as TCN (The Commercial Network) – in 1981 as exclusive German partner and is still building on its many international market contacts. At that time the ICPA comprised 81 partner companies with around 3,000 property specialists. In Germany, too, AENGEVELT bundled key synergies and in 1989 founded DIP Deutsche Immobilien-Partner together with three other major real estate service providers. DIP currently has 6 partners, with a total of 15 locations, and operates throughout Germany and also in Austria. At the turn of the year 1989/1990, AENGEVELT exploited the opportunities presented by the fall of the Berlin Wall and was the first West German estate agency to open an office in Berlin. In August 1990, the company published the first comprehensive market report in the history of the Berlin property market. To do this, AENGEVELT commissioned extensive primary data surveys in the eastern part of the city and asked the Humboldt University to draw up a precise inventory of office buildings in the former East Berlin – something for which previously only estimates had existed. Very early on, AENGEVELT recognised the importance of excellent professional training against the backdrop of the constantly growing demands being placed on real estate consulting. For this reason, for decades the company has both required and promoted ongoing professional training for its staff as well as the creation and expansion of corresponding training establishments. AENGEVELT is one of the initiators and founders of the highly respected Chair of Real Estate Economics at the European Business School (EBS), established in March 1990, where members of the company also lecture.  At the end of 1990 / beginning of 1991, AENGVELT and DIP were then commissioned by the Federal Government Privatisation Agency (East) to develop a disposal methodology for properties owned by the former state-owned collectives which were now surplus to requirements. To accomplish this extremely complex task, the company was able to draw on its experience from the ""Langenfeld model"", and the result was the ""Berlin model"", known in the former East Germany as the “TLG model” but with exactly the same content. This model was then practised with great success by AENGEVELT and its DIP partners in 82 national and international invitations to tender, effectively kick-starting the real estate markets in East Berlin and the former East German provinces. Using the model, total investments of over DM 18.6 billion were secured in over 400 notarised contracts – as well as more than 78,000 jobs. Between 1991 and 1996, the company continued its unhalting expansion and opened offices in Leipzig (1 October 1991), Magdeburg (1 August 1992), Moscow (1 March 1993), Bonn (1 August 1995) and Frankfurt am Main (1 May 1996).  Today AENGEVELT is one of the largest and most experienced international property service companies in Germany and employs over 200 real estate specialists. The company offers its clients a range of services stretching from the sale of private and investment properties and commercial lets, placement of undeveloped land, industrial and commercial properties, through to competent advisory services and complex project developments. Added to this is AENGEVELT’s continuous, exemplary research and reporting activities offering real guidance with their comprehensive analysis and research in the relevant market segments which, as hindsight bears witness to, pinpoint relevant industry developments precisely and are available as detailed information foundations for decision-making. In our fast-moving Internet age, the future is posing fresh challenges due to the growing internationalisation of the markets and, as a result of this, constantly increasing demands placed on property consulting. AENGEVELT is optimally placed to meet these challenges: the new head office at Kennedydamm 55 on the corner of Kennedydamm and Rossstraße, which the company moved into in summer 2000, offers the very best in communications and therefore transparency – both within and outside. All in all, this embodies an ideal synthesis of innovation and decades of experience: AENGEVELT serves its clients’ interests by being completely independent of any bank, insurance company or corporation. From the Kennedydamm in Düsseldorf and its four branch offices, AENGEVELT is setting out the future of real estate!"

It is the act of reading, which in itself involves a support of unique cultural and social importance, due to the knowledge that is attributed to it and the symbolic value that it represents in the knowledge society. It is this experience that we want to provide through the Accessible Library, literary content platform, with accessibility features for reading in braille and audio description. As an example of the high cost of producing Braille material, let us take the book Os Maias, by Eça de Queiroz. With its 487 pages printed, this single publication generates 20 braille volumes, with an average of 100 pages, and would have the final cost of R $ 9,350.40 per unit transcribed. A state that has 500 libraries in its schools, for example, would have to disburse $ 4,675,200.00 just to have this single book in its collections. Consisting primarily of an Android tablet and Braille mouse - where the user has the tactile feel of reading - and a digital collection of 150 initial books, the Accessible Library seeks to converge content and reduce costs in the availability of readable points for people with visual impairment, including the audio description of the text for users who do not have braille fluency. A unit of the Affordable Library, with its collection of 150 books, is equivalent to the same content that would occupy 812 bound volumes and would cost R$ 389,779.20 if the shipment was transcribed to Braille. In order to demonstrate the economy generated by the platform, we set the example in the educational scenario of the municipal network of Fortaleza in 82 schools, where we tried to measure for the period of four years the economy generated from the use of the platform. Although the scenarios - school reality and the context of the libraries - have their particularities, we could measure an economy of more than 3 million reais, in the continuous availability of accessible books in the period from 2013 to 2017, since Braille, in the same period - four years on average - loses tactile properties, making it unusable."

Instead of taking a pill, inhale nanoaerosol.  They have experimentally established that, delivering drugs by nanoaerosol, in order to get the same effect as that from oral administration, only a tiny fraction of a drug is needed, preventing side effects.  As an example, delivering Ibuprofen and Indomethacin by nanoaerosol, the amount of the drugs needed in order to have the same effect as that from the oral administration, is less by 6 orders of magnitude (i.e. by 1000000 times).  Why is that? Because nanoaerosol is delivered directly into the blood, avoiding the digestive system and liver metabolism. The effect is instant.  Micron-size aerosols can't penetrate so far into the respiratory system as nanoaerosols.  Drugs which can only be used by injection, can be delivered by nanoaerosol too, avoiding painful injections."

Aero-News Network,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/aero-news-network,"News, Publishing",An Online Daily Aviation Aerospace News Resource.,"ANN is, first and foremost, the work of some dedicated folks who have put their hearts (and souls) into promoting and protecting the aviation community. Born out of the blood, sweat, and tears of many hard years of aviation journalism, ANN was designed to take the vital and much-needed next step in the evolution of information sharing about and within the aerospace world. ANN is the brainchild of US Aviator magazine Publisher and Aviation Safety Advocate Jim Campbell (below), whose brave efforts to bring constructive and honest information to the aviation industry are well-known, for all kinds of reasons. The aviation industry often seems to bury its head in the sand when it comes to the threats and dangers that threaten to destroy the people, programs and products that populate it. For a dozen years, Campbell and his valiant little magazine told the world of aviation what no one else dared to... namely that there were products and manufacturers out there who did not tell the truth or were actually dangerous, and that many of the entities that we had learned to trust as Aviators, especially the FAA, simply could not be trusted. That proud little magazine fought many battles, and in fact,  never actually lost a single fight (but, boy... did it get its nose bloodied a few times...). But, it paid a helluva cost. Yes, it was a great fight, but a flawed one. The new reality of near-instant information and the critical nature of the data that Campbell and his partners could provide, demanded something better and more immediate in order that their work have the greatest impact. Campbell's burgeoning realization indicated that it was getting rather fruitless to kill new trees with old news, and it was time for those speedy little electrons to do their stuff. Hence, ANN. Together; with some of the best folks he's ever worked with, ANN is blazing a NEW trail and doing what this aero-business has never seen before. ANN means Real-Time Aviation News, valuable columns, features and event coverage, weather, classifieds, aero-marketing resources, discussion boards, and much, much more. There are no shrinking violets here... we've all had our noses bloodied, we've had our faces rubbed in the mud for trying to do the right thing (and not always succeeding), we've gotten pummeled for sticking up for people who may not have been able to stick up for themselves and we've had to face down folks who have broken every rule in the book, moral, ethical, and legal, to keep us from trying to protect our brethren. We've learned a lot  the hard way, and not a single one of us have ever backed down, no matter how tough the risks we faced. We are not bashful, we are not shy, and we promise you that the courage and bravery we see all around us in those who fight for their love of aviation and the safety of their fellow Aviators, will not be lost upon us, but will guide us in everything we do. So... Who Are We? We are the Aero-News Network: An Online Daily Aviation Aerospace News Resource. We have a strong commitment to safety, consumer activism, Aero-education, and Aero-entertainment (let's face it, the main reason most of us come to aviation is because it is a lot of fun and we dare not forget that no matter how serious the subject matter may be). ANN will be, at first, what we make it, but ultimately it will be what YOU make it. We implore you all to demand the very best of us, to offer your suggestions, questions, criticism, and News-Spy Tips... and to participate fully in every aspect of ANN's growth and posture. We ask you to be highly critical of us, and to take your time to point out what we're doing wrong or not doing at all, and what you think we need to be addressing. So... that in the long run, when people ask who those ANN guys are; that, in addition to folks like Jim Campbell, Tom Patton, Nathan Cremisino, Ashley Hale, Ed Downs, Birgit Pauli-Haack, and many other talented fly-writers and photographers, that YOUR names, wishes and concerns will be a big part of it as well."
