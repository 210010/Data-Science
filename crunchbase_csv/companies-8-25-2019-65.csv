Micreos,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/micreos,"Biotechnology, Product Design, Product Research","Micreos, a Wageningen, The Netherlands-based developer of phage technology for targeted control of bacteria.","According to the World Health Organization (WHO)  emergence of antibiotic-resistant 'superbugs' is now a global concern, which can spell the end of modern medicine and a return to the days when routine operations, simple wounds or straightforward infections were potentially life-threatening.  On the other hand scientists have come to realize that the vast majority of bacteria is beneficial and should be left intact. Antibiotics do not distinguish between bad and good  bacteria and their use can lead to side effects and resistance.  Micreos develops the world's first targeted antibacterial products, set to replace antibiotics. With Micreos' endolysin technology, for the first time it is possible to kill only the unwanted bacteria - including antibiotic resistant strains such as MRSA - while leaving our microbiome - comprising billions of beneficial bacteria on our skin and in our gut - intact. In addition, research shows that the use of endolysins does not induce resistance. This unlocks a completely new approach in dealing with the bacteria around us: killing the bad bacteria and preserving the microbiome.  Micreos' Staphefekt SA.100 is an enzyme (endolysin), that targets only Staphylococcus aureus. Marketed under the Gladskin brand, it is the world's first endolysin registered for human use and has had a life-changing impact for thousands of people suffering from inflammatory skin conditions such as eczema, inflammatory acne and rosacea and resistant wound infections (see www.gladskin.com).  A series of pharmaceutical products based on the endolysin XZ.700 - also targeting S. aureus - is in clinical development. First indications include: atopic dermatitis, diabetic wound infections and folliculitis.    Micreos has also developed FDA-approved food safety products: 'Phageguard S' against Salmonella and 'Phageguard L' against Listeria monocytogenes, which is especially dangerous for pregnant women and for the elderly and immuno-compromised (www.phageguard.com)."

Mitochondria generates ATP, the energy source for all cellular activities. Mitochondria are also involved in other essential cellular functions, including calcium sequestration, amino acid and lipid metabolism, keeping balanced redox potential and orchestrating programmed cell death. In neurons in particular, mitochondria are very dynamic organelles that constantly undergo fission (division) and fusion. This process, called mitochondrial dynamics, is critical in maintaining healthy and functional mitochondria under both normal conditions and in response to stress and in ensuring having viable mitochondria along the axons and in the synaptic boutons. A defect in either fusion or fission limits mitochondrial motility, decreases energy production, increases oxidative stress and activates pro-apoptotic signaling thereby promoting cell dysfunction and death. Mitoconix’ lead drug is a first-in-class inhibitor of pathological mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction with demonstrated in vivo efficacy in animal models of Huntington’s (HD) and Parkinson’s diseases (PD) and beneficial activity in patient-derived cells of HD, sporadic and genetic PD, and sporadic and genetic Alzheimer’s disease (AD)."

By exposing the saturated plastic to enough heat to soften it rather than melt it, the gas will nucleate into billions of bubbles, and be held in place by the solid state plastic. Eight years ago our founders realized that applying this technology to the most recycled plastic on earth would result in dramatic impacts in the sustainability.  On September 11, 2002, MicroGREEN Polymers was incorporated in Washington State. The ""Micro"" part of our name is an abbreviation of microcellular technology, while ""green"" connotes the eco-friendly nature of that technology.

Another 250,000 patients have exhausted non-surgical treatment and opt for surgery. Minimus Spine believes that it can benefit these patients with a single injection and reduce the number of patients that ultimately need surgery.Minimus Spine is developing ozone injection technology specifically for spinal applications. Ozone has been used to treat disc herniations in Europe for over 15 years and there are over 20 peer-reviewed papers documenting over 8,000 patients. We have improved upon the existing technology through a system that creates ozone, and measures its concentration, within in a sterile, syringe-cartridge (patents pending). This has advantages in terms of sterility and dose assurance, as well as material compatibility, which are vital to the advancement of this technique. Minimus will commercialize its product outside the United States and then begin working with FDA to offer this technology in the U.S. This will involve rigorous clinical trials conducted by spine surgeons and interventional radiologists.  The study will seek to confirm that an injection of ozone into a herniated disc is both safe and effective. The results of these trials will be submitted to FDA for marketing approval. Currently, ozone cannot be legally marketed for medical application in the U.S. and FDA has justifiably taken enforcement actions against manufacturer’s that promote this treatment without FDA approval. This product is not yet available but the push is being made to begin clinical trials in 2011.  Check back periodically for more information. Minimus hopes to improve patient care and believes it can save the health care system significant resources on unnecessary steroid injections and surgeries."

MiniVax,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/minivax,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Therapeutics",MiniVax is focused on the development of solutions for the treatment and prevention of opportunistic infections.,"MiniVax is focused on the development of novel solutions for the treatment and prevention of opportunistic infections. It is currently developing solutions for the indication Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). The fungus Pneumocystis commonly resides in the lungs of healthy individuals, but the infection PCP does not arise until a person’s immune system is depressed at which time the Pneumocystis pathogens can replicate and cause an infection. PCP is the most common opportunistic infection in HIV/AIDS patients. It also affects other immunocompromised patients including those less than two years of age and over seventy years of age and those undergoing cancer treatment, immunosuppression for organ transplant surgery, corticosteroid treatment, or other immunosuppressive therapy.After infection occurs, PCP has a high mortality rate. MiniVax’s lead product candidate is a monoclonal antibody (PCP-Antibody) for the treatment of PCP. For those patients already suffering from PCP that are plagued by an average mortality rate of 20%, PCP-Antibody will provide an immediate defense against PC by delivering the antibodies needed to fight off the infection and thereby reducing the risk of mortality. A follow on product is a novel vaccine (PCP-Vaccine) for the prevention of PCP. PCP-Vaccine promotes the development of long term anti-Pneumocystis antibodies in patients receiving the vaccine. The antibodies help immunocompromised patients prevent Pneumocystis infection and, therefore, prevent PCP development. Similar to childhood vaccinations, one multi-dose regimen of PCP-Vaccine will be needed to confer lifetime protection. In addition to the therapeutic antibody and vaccine, MiniVax is developing a diagnostic (PCP-Diagnostic) for the detection of a Pneumocystis infection. Currently, clinical diagnosis of PCP is limited to immunohistochemistry and examination of chest X-rays, which have limited sensitivity, specificity, and speed. It takes a highly experienced physician to diagnose PCP. PCP-Diagnostic will provide a quick and accurate means of diagnosing PCP, thus ensuring that the appropriate treatment is prescribed in a timely manner. The preliminary technology for MiniVax’s PCP products was developed by Dr. Jay Kolls and Dr. Mingquan Zheng at Louisiana State University Health and Science Center (LSUHSC). Drs. Kolls and Zheng initially studied an immunogenic protein in Pneumocystis called Kexin, which provided protection against Pneumocystis in initial animal studies. Approximately five years and $4 million were spent in the lab developing this technology before MiniVax became operational in mid-2011. Currently, MiniVax is further developing the technology through federal and state grants."
