For the landscape and garden enthusiast, Rachio provides complete control with truly customized scheduling and instantaneous, one-touch sprinkler controls from a smartphone.   Iro is incredibly easy to install and takes only minutes to set up.  During setup, the homeowner’s smartphone sends a signal to the Iro, connecting it to the internet through a WiFi network through which it then communicates securely with Rachio’s cloud-based software.  At that point, homeowners can connect to their yard from anywhere in the world through an intuitive, lightning-fast smartphone app or through a web-dashboard.  With the push of a button, sprinklers can be turned on instantaneously from anywhere in the world.  In addition to fully-customizable and instantaneous control, Iro can be set to automatically adjust irrigation schedules.  Automated scheduling is optimized for water-efficiency and landscape health by taking into account numerous variables including weather, seasonality, landscape characteristics, water budgeting and vegetation.  Additionally, it learns from the customer’s adjustments over time, allowing them to personalize the balance between water use and the “level of health” in each zone of their yards."

Traditional PBMs tend to make more money when medications are more expensive and when patients take more of them.    Renew Health’s business model is designed to align with health plans and patients. We envision charging fixed fees on a per-member and per-task basis to administer medications while passing through drug related costs and rebates to health plans. Renew Health would also be compensated for delivering clinical services designed to improve outcomes and lower the total cost of care for health plans, thereby aligning Renew Health’s revenue with value for payers and patients."

Consumers can then select and book appointments with their top choice service provider based on a comparison of business profiles, price quotes, and ratings and reviews from past Redbeacon consumers.

Dilated cardiomyopathy is a condition affecting over 3 million patients in the US and growing steadily. Many patients develop DCM due to ischemic heart disease.

These patients are typically younger and progress to end stage heart failure sooner than patients with ischemic heart disease. Currently DCM patients with a BAG3 mutation are treated with standard of care for heart failure.

Rewards.com is a brand agnostic loyalty point’s clearinghouse that consolidates all your loyalty programs into one easy efficient marketplace where customers shop, earn points, redeem points, and take advantage of discounts. Rewards.com was spun off from DBG Loyalty in Dallas, a leading innovator in loyalty and rewards marketing programs for Bank of America, Sony, Caesars Entertainment, General Motors, Nissan, Toronto Dominion Bank, American Airlines, Marriott and more, equating to over 30 million customers. The startup includes the executive leadership and mature platform from the parent company. The platform is solid and proven, with 10k registered users, over 7000 coalition merchants including Jet.com, Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Uber, Quicken Loans, Smithsonian, Hyatt, Susan G. Komen, and many more. Revenue is generated each time someone makes a purchase on a merchant site. The merchants pay a commission of 3% to 75% of the total sale to Rewards.com. They also provide special offers, coupons, and discounts for driving high sales volumes to their online storefronts. Rewards.com keeps 40% – 60% of the commission and passes a portion on to the customer. Rewards.com has a significant advantage because it is brand agnostic means it has partnerships and partnership potential with thousands of companies. Being an agnostic loyalty point’s coalition that consolidates loyalty programs into one easy efficient shopping site, is a market first. URL: www.Rewards.com  Industry: Loyalty Points Clearinghouse  What: Consolidates all your loyalty programs into one easy and efficient marketplace  Beta Launch: June 2017  Current Situation: Platform is built and already has 10k active users; over 7000 coalition merchants including Jet.com, Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Uber, Quicken Loans, Smithsonian, CBS, Hyatt, Susan G. Komen, and more.  PROBLEM IN THE MARKET Customers have an average of 29 loyalty programs per. Redeeming is a nightmare.  Customers are tired of too many programs and not enough reward. SOLUTION Rewards.com is a brand agnostic loyalty points clearing house that consolidates all your loyalty programs into one easy and efficient clearinghouse marketplace where customers shop, earn points, redeem points, and take advantage of discounts. The company was spun out of a 15-year old loyalty database marketing company (DBG Loyalty located in Dallas) who is a leading innovator in loyalty and rewards marketing programs for Bank of America, Sony, Caesars Entertainment, General Motors, Nissan, Toronto Dominion Bank, American Airlines, Marriott and more, equating to over 30 million customers. WHY NOW? Coalitions are highly successful in other countries and have been for many years.  The timing is right for the United States and Rewards.com is the right opportunity because it is credit card, bank, and retailer neutral, giving it an edge in forming partnerships with coalition members. MARKET SIZE $291 billion ecommerce industry in the US. (*IBIS World) The Rewards.com Marketplace literally allows a shopper to purchase anything. Electronics, Department Stores, Travel, Office Supplies, Gift Cards, and Home goods are among the most popular categories. Shoppers of all ages, races, and incomes have increasingly more expectations of lower prices combined with a higher value. Rewards Marketplace is the solution for both, giving the Rewards Marketplace an edge over singular businesses that depend on either a low-cost or high-value strategies. The target market includes shoppers who are making purchases online or through a mobile device or tablet, as well as at in-store. Our goal is to identify profitable customers and their purchase patterns, and reward desirable behavior accordingly. Truly giving insight and understanding to behavior loyalty. BUSINESS MODEL Breakage and float are two strategic parts of gift cards and point redemptions. The value of unredeemed points and unused gift cards has significant value. Rewards.com sells points as part of their service offering to marketplace members, and breakage has accrued value. Ultimately Rewards wins if a shopper redeems their point because essentially they just made another purchase that is subject to retailer commission. In addition, revenue is derived from: •	Merchants pay a commission of 3% to 75% of the total sale to Rewards.com for customers and provide special offers, coupons, and discounts for driving high sales volumes to their online storefronts. •	Rewards.com keeps 40% – 60% of the commission and passes a portion on to the customer. •	Revenue from “Featured Advertising” and product placement •	Revenue from Email promotions to the Rewards.com customer database TECHNOLOGY •	Scalable software architecture with the flexibility to dynamically target customers and feature partners. •	Easy for customers to use and gain valuable shopping experiences with the incentives for the masses. COMPETITION Ebates.com is a cash-back model. Although hugely successful they struggle with shopper engagement and retaining shoppers year-after-year. Churn is high and engagement is low. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE Rewards.com has a significant advantage because it is brand agnostic means it has partnerships and partnership potential with thousands of companies. Being an agnostic loyalty point’s coalition that consolidates loyalty programs into one easy efficient shopping site is a market first. •	Mature and proven technology platform is live •	Seasoned executives who innovated loyalty programs for American Airlines, American Express, IHG and more. •	Estimated customer base 30mm •	Signed strategic partnerships MARKETING PLAN With a $3m raise, $2m will be spent reaching two goals. •	The first goal is to reach 105k active subscribers to reach $7m in revenue. •	The second goal is to reach 180k active subscribers to reach critical mass.

RxVantage,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rxvantage,"Cloud Computing, Enterprise Software, Medical",RxVantage provides cloud-based software that enables efficient communication of medical practices.,"RxVantage is OpenTable.com for pharma reps (and other medical vendors) looking to access physicians.  The company's cloud-based platform improves patient outcomes and enhances the relationship between medical representatives and physicians’ offices.  The Problem:  The pharmaceutical industry spends $60 billion per year marketing, most of which is directed to the physicians who determine how the $325 billion that Americans spend each year on prescription drugs will be allocated. These marketing dollars go toward reaching docs at the point of care via sales reps that provide free samples and educational materials for patients, and medical education to doctors and their staff. All pharma brands must be in the practice if they hope to succeed. The last decade has seen an explosion of novel medical technologies and treatments, along with a corresponding increase in the number of reps promoting them. More than 130,000 reps visit the 30,000 busiest medical practices every day. These practices see value in what individual reps deliver, however, they are often overwhelmed by a community of reps that cannot organize itself to fit the practices’ schedules and priorities.   In an attempt to control the rep chaos, these practices often dedicate hundreds of staff hours per year to coordinating rep visits on handwritten paper calendars and business cards. With pharma having demonstrated more than a 1000% ROI on such visits, far higher than any other sales/marketing channel, demand for access far outstrips supply.  Despite this high demand, more than 30% of these appointments are abandoned by the scheduled rep and go unfilled, a paradox that occurs because: 1. Appointments are booked up to one year in advance by reps that must be in the practice. 2. Rep turnover is high, and territories and physician targets are constantly realigned. 3. Appointment information is locked inside tens of thousands of individual paper calendars. Unfortunately, the burden on staff time and the high rate of “no-show” appointments can lead a practice to reduce rep access to their doctors, or, eliminate it all together. As a result, the most effective channel pharma has to educate doctors about new treatments is becoming a victim of its own success.  Enter RxVantage:  Our technology enables practices to control the flow of reps in their office without utilizing staff time, which can then be re-focused on patients. Putting the practice back in control empowers them to remain open to receiving the valuable education and services that reps provide. This is especially important given studies showing that physicians not seeing reps are 4X slower to react to new information, both positive (i.e. new standard of care) and negative (i.e. product recall). In addition to keeping the practices’ doors open, RxVantage creates more opportunities for reps within each practice. By freeing the appointment data from the cages of the paper calendars, we apply our innovative technology to every appointment in order to predict and eliminate “no-shows” before they happen. By enabling other reps to book these appointments that otherwise would have been wasted, RxVantage makes the sales forces that call on our medical practices 30% more productive. More than 11,000 reps from 400 companies have used RxVantage to book over 120,000 appointments with 1,200 practices containing 4,000 high-prescribing physicians. At this scale the company has created more than $100MM in value for pharma by virtue of the 40,000+ appointments that would not have occurred in the absence of our technology. In the next 18 months, as new financing allows us to ramp this proven sales process and support the channel partnerships that we have negotiated, the value we create for pharma will exceed $1BB across a network that includes 50,000 physicians. The RxVantage platform includes a dedicated online medical rep scheduling calendar, a communication hub that enables practices to efficiently interact with reps, a sample request tool, up-to-date directory of patient assistance programs, and a drug coupon database."
