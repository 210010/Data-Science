The magnetic fields of two properly designed devices with closely matched resonant frequencies can couple into a single continuous magnetic field.

This âœstrong couplingâ€ enables the devices to exchange energy via magnetism, and avoids the potential safety hazards and inefficiency often associated with radiated electro-magnetic energy. Their demonstration of wireless power transfer showed a 60 watt light bulb being illuminated from a power source over 2 meters away, and their results were published in the prestigious journal Science in July 2007.    Prof. Solja was recognized with a MacArthur Fellowship in September 2008, awarded by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.

Through their scale and network, they are able to provide oneway taxi rental upto 50% lower than other vendors who charge for roundtrip even for a drop. You can compare different cab rentals on their feedback rating on driver, cabs and agency quality. They intend to organize the fragmented taxi industry under their platform to provide transparent services to all. Well it all started when I could not book a train ticket under Tatkal scheme to attend a family function in Chandigarh and I had to book a cab instead. I just needed a drop to Chandigarh but the vendor charged me for the roundtrip as he wouldn’t get the return fare. Throughout my journey, I felt that it was a massive waste of money, fuel and human resources. Also it somehow didn’t make sense to me why it should be the state of affairs as there must be hundreds of people travelling in opposite direction. Why can they not match these passengers up with these taxis and this would save all the hassle? During the casual chat with the driver, who had grayed his hair in taxi industry, I learnt that the whole industry functions in this manner and they charge for both ways. This got me thinking that this was the high time that somebody stood up and tackled this long pending problem. Thus the core idea behind Wiwigo was formed. At the foundation of Wiwigo platform, they have their rating system that is invitation based so that it cannot be tampered with. The customers who once complete their journey with us are requested to rate their experience on driver, cab and agency on quality. This rating system and upfront pricing creates the much needed transparency. The rating system also encourages cab vendors to improve their services to get better feedback and hence more bookings.

Williams Grand Prix Engineering Limited,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/williams-grand-prix-engineering-limited,"Automotive, Innovation Management, Manufacturing, Racing",Williams Advanced Engineering Limited is the technology and engineering services business of the Williams Group.,"Williams Grand Prix Engineering Ltd is founded by Frank Williams and an ambitious British engineer called Patrick Head. The company is based in an empty carpet warehouse in Didcot, Oxfordshire, and enters a purchased March chassis in order to compete in F1 during the latter half of the season.  At the same time it sets about designing a car to contest the 1978 FIA Formula One WorldChampionship with a staff of just 17 people. Frank Williams finds a consortium of Middle Eastern backers to support the team’s efforts and the first car, the FW06, is shaken down at the end of the year with Australian ace Alan Jones behind the wheel.  Williams has won 16 FIA Formula One World Championships (nine for constructors, in partnership with Cosworth, Honda and Renault, and seven for drivers, with Alan Jones, Keke Rosberg, Nelson Piquet, Nigel Mansell, Alain Prost, Damon Hill and Jacques Villeneuve). The team has scored 114 victories, 308 podiums and 128 pole positions.  The team’s endeavours have earned Frank Williams a knighthood, as well as the French equivalent, the Légion d’honneur. The company has two Queen’s Awards for Export Achievement and it’s recognised as one of the most enduring and successful organisations in sport.  Over the years Williams has nurtured many great talents, both in the cockpit and in the design office. The team gave Ayrton Senna his first F1 test in 1983; it was with Williams that Nigel Mansell scored his first grand prix win, in 1985, and his only world title in 1992, and it was with Williams that Damon Hill took all but one of his 22 race victories and the ’96 world title. The list could go on.  Some of F1’s cleverest technical brains also cut their teeth at Williams. The list of Williams’ design alumni includes Adrian Newey, Paddy Lowe, Ross Brawn, Neil Oatley and Frank Dernie, and we’re equally proud of our current technical team led by Pat Symonds - Chief Technical Officer.  Engineering excellence is at the heart of Williams’ DNA. Whether it’s building the carbon fibre chassis of this year’s FW37, or our own eight-speed, seamless-shift, semi-automatic gearbox the team aims to obtain performance and reliability from every component on the car. As a result, it takes a lot of pride in the constructors’ trophies it has won because the constructors’ championship is the most accurate gauge of a team’s performance relative to its rivals. On nine occasions in its history, Williams has beaten everyone.  The team’s business model is unique in the pit lane. While many of the other teams are extensions of multinational companies’ marketing departments, Williams is wholly independent; it exists solely to go racing. Its commercial partnerships must drive value back to its partners’ companies. To meet these expectations, the team has grown exponentially since 1977. What started out as a group of 17 people has mushroomed into a company that now employs more than 600 people at its technology campus in Grove, Oxfordshire.  Williams Advanced Engineering is the technology and engineering services business of the Williams Group. Williams Advanced Engineering provides world class technical innovation, engineering, testing, and manufacturing services to deliver energy efficient performance to the automotive, motorsport, transport and energy sectors. Williams Advanced Engineering specialises in Advanced Lightweight Materials, Hybrid Power Systems and Electronics, Cutting Edge Aerodynamics, Vehicle Dynamics and Holistic Integration capabilities.

This qualitative, “feet on the street,” lifestyle information is usually more important than the property itself, and has traditionally only been available by word-of-mouth.  Unfortunately, all too often, you don’t find out until you’re already moved in, and it’s too late. We are an online community for connecting Homebuyers with neighborhood information beyond just stats and figures. Here, you can find the answers to questions like: How hard is it to get into a good school? Is it safe to play in the parks? Are there any good health food stores nearby? Is there a neighborhood recreation center? What is that new development down the street, and how will it impact my property value? Answers and information is provided by other members of the community, including residents and real estate professionals, who have lived and worked in the neighborhood - often times, for decades. Another challenge we’re committed to overcoming is that of selecting the right real estate professional who will advocate for you and hold your hand through the biggest purchasing decision of your life. Too many people select an agent from a flier, bus stop billboard, or shopping cart ad. Then you’re swept up and pressured into a relationship with someone you don’t necessarily gel with. What if you had the opportunity to get to know agents before deciding who to give commission to? WikiRealty allows you to explore expert insight, ask and answer questions, develop a relationship via direct messaging and text messages, and see what other professionals the agent has in their network who can help complete the process - from inspection, through title insurance, local landscapers, possible legal referrals, and potential construction contacts. Your kids will go to school and play in this neighborhood. The people here will be your neighbors for years to come. They say you don’t choose your family, but you can choose where you live and how your kids will grow up. At WikiRealty, we provide you the chance to meet and get to know your potential future friends and neighbors before even moving in."

WikiWorldBook,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wikiworldbook,"Public Relations, Search Engine",WikiWorldBook is a software program that serves as a free online address book.,"WikiWorldBook's primary purpose is to reinvent the telephone book for email by enabling people to find and instantly email other people via a Google search of their name. As globalisation rapidly shrinks the world, one of the big challenges now is how to find and contact people instantly, wherever they are located. The first thing that most people do when they want to find someone is Google them. What they generally find is a long list of social networking profiles that they cannot access for messaging unless they are a member. WikiWorldBook provides a free online address book which gives users a free individual ""Home Page"" for their contact details on the web. Uniquely, this highly search engine optimised page enables people to be found via a Google search of their name and instantly contacted online by email, without having to reveal any of their contact details. Users can keep their email address hidden behind a message form and a powerful spam filter removes spam before messages are forwarded to the user's regular email account, so they do not have to return to the website to pick them up. Message senders do not have to register enabling message sending to take place in seconds. The web service currently has around 25,000 registered users and appeals to a very broad range of people from every nationality and socio-economic background. The site is marketed as a ""directory service"" rather than a ""social service"" and this low maintenance aspect broadens its appeal to users who already conduct their online social and business lives on walled garden sites like Facebook and LinkedIn. Existing competition within the ""online address book"" business category includes Plaxo and Unyk, which are ""walled garden"" websites, and Telnic. The introduction of WikiWorldBook's new instant email service within this existing business category would be a ""game changer"". The existing providers, which maintain a walled garden model to increase their subscriptions, are unlikely to become more open until forced to by competition and are likely to resist this change in the short term. The web service has been reported by a number of mainstream and web based media including The BBC and The Guardian."

We'll bring you together and make sure you meet the right job or the right candidate. It's about time someone set out to do something different."" Wiseri is a job search platform which has a simple and sincere goal: to help as many people as possible find a job and to help businesses find the best candidates. The wiseri selection process ensures that candidates are only presented to companies where they have a good chance of being offered a job, and conversely, that companies are only presented with candidates with the skills and experience they are looking for. In November 2011, wiseri.com secured a round of investment worth 120,000 euros which was provided by 17 investors, all of whom are involved in the digital industries. Crucially for wiseri, this meant they brought to the company not only their money, but also their expertise and experience in the industry. In similar style to the way businesses in Silicon Valley secure seed capital, this investment round did not involve any outside investors or investment funds; but rather, the funds were provided by people who know and believe in what wiseri does. Furthermore, the round of investment was carried out from start to finish in a record time of 37 days and all communication between wiseri and its investors was conducted through email with complete transparency. On 14th January 2012, wiseri revealed a new side of its online platform, a system that sources talent from the crowd to form an expert selection team. In doing so, wiseri became the first company in the job search industry to incorporate gamification and crowdsourcing into its system. Members of the selection team are called Wisors and any job application made through wiseri.com first has to pass through the hands of a Wisor, who selects only those applications best matched to the job position and presents them to the company, taking care to give genuine and useful feedback to each candidate who didn't quite make it to ensure they have a better chance the next time round. And to make sure that the applications are checked by someone who knows what they're doing, only people who have already passed through the wiseri application system can go on to become Wisors; and once you are a Wisor, well, then you can enjoy a whole range of perks along the way, saving up wirees (wiseri's currency) as you go that you can cash in for a whole load of prizes.?"

By implementing e-commerce best practices, we help this underserved market grow both their audience and revenue significantly. The problem we are solving-->> Online retailers excel at the bottom of the purchase funnel: search and decision, but fail in inspiration and browse. Consumers visit retail sites with a product in mind, and never browse the inventory retailers try to promote and expose.  Online influencers have really figured out inspiration. They have a dedicated audience that comes for inspiration and ends up purchasing based on what they read and see. But the whole shopping experience for these influencers is based on simple text links, lacking all the standard best practices we're used to in e-commerce experiences (similar items, hotness signals, recommendations, search or browse paths). Our solution-->> Witlee bridges that gap by providing the best e-commerce solution for influencers today. We provide influencers with a retail standard, e-commerce storefront that's fully based on their images, and implement all the current e-commerce best practices across desktop and mobile.

Luxton was founding owner and editor of the Winnipeg Free Press. From the day the first edition rolled off the presses in 1872, the Winnipeg Free Press has been an integral part of the city and province it serves. It is a position the newspaper is certain to maintain in the new millennium. Part of the for the Free Press’ success can be attributed to the fact that it is only two years younger than the province of Manitoba, which joined Confederation in 1870, and actually two years older than the City of Winnipeg, which was incorporated in 1874. the result is that the newspaper has been around as long as the community itself, faithfully recording the growth and development of a muddy Prairie settlement at the forks of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers into one of Canada’s leading cities and the capital of a thriving province of more than one million people. Indeed, there is no other major newspaper in Canada that is so closely associated with the hopes, dreams and ambitions of its readers than the Free Press. Over the years, the newspaper has gained a reputation as the province's leading source of news, information and debate about local matters and ideas, as well as Manitoba’s voice on national and international issues. Sir Clifford Sifton – Western patriarch, federal cabinet minister, and owner of the Free Press at the turn of the century. It is a reputation that can be traced back to the original owner and editor of the Free Press, W.F. Luxton, and his partner John A. Kenny. Together, these men launched a newspaper that was to grow into a formidable journalistic and commercial force and serve as the linchpin for a national chain of newspapers stretching across much of the country. With a population of 1,467, the Winnipeg of 1872 was the largest of several budding communities in Manitoba at a time when the future was as wide open and bright as the blue Prairie sky. Yet its future was by no means assured. By late 1880, the recently incorporated City of Winnipeg found itself in a competition with the nearby communities of Selkirk and Emerson for the new railroad that was being built across the country. After some debate, Winnipeg was eventually selected as the site, forever assuring the community's place as the province's leading city and providing the Free Press with a source of readers that would help make it one of the most important newspapers in the country. By the turn of the century, Manitoba had become an important player on the national scene. The railroad had helped bring hundreds of thousands of settlers to the Prairies, making Winnipeg a boomtown and the most important city in the West. And as the city became more important in local and national affairs, so did the Free Press. In retrospect, it is clear that two developments at this time were crucial to the continued success of the Free Press and its eventual development as one of Canada’s great newspapers. One was the acquisition of the newspaper by Sir Clifford Sifton, a man who distinguished himself as a powerful cabinet minister in the government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier and would be remembered as one of the patriarchs of Western Canada. The other was Sifton’s decision to hire John W. Dafoe as editor of the newspaper and E.H.. Macklin as its chief business manager. Together, these three men provided the Free Press with the journalistic and commercial leadership required to outlast its competitors and maintain its position as the largest selling newspaper in Manitoba. The Winnipeg Free Press building on Mountain Avenue was completed in 1991. Along with equipment representing the latest in newspaper technology. Other journalists also contributed to the growing reputation of the Free Press. Cora Hind, who joined the Free Press in 1901 as an agriculture writer, was one of the leading female journalists of her day. Legend has it that she could walk into a grain field in August and predict the size of the crop in the fall. Over the years, the Free Press has continued to build on the foundation laid down by Sifton, Dafoe and Macklin. As the city and province grew, so did the newspaper’s circulation. By the mid-1980s, the Free Press had outgrown its once–grand downtown quarters at 300 Carlton Street and began developing plans for construction of a $150–million plant on Mountain Avenue, in the city's northwestern corner. Completed in 1991, the new building and its equipment represented the latest in newspaper technology. The three state–of–the–art computerized presses are capable of world–class colour reproduction and can each print newspapers at a rate of 75,000 per hour. In December, 2001, a new era began for the Free Press. The newspaper, along with sister paper Brandon Sun, was bought from Thomson Newspapers by FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership, a company founded by Ronald Stern and Bob Silver, two businessmen with strong Winnipeg roots. Stern and Silver, both born and raised in the city, have been partners for 20 years in Western Glove Works and, for lesser amounts of time, in other businesses, including two large newsprint mills in Alberta and Ontario. Stern is also the former publisher of Vancouver Magazine. The purchase of the Free Press by Stern and Silver bucked the North American trend toward bigger media companies. With the purchase, FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership became the owner of the largest independent newspaper in Canada. The success of any newspaper depends on more than good journalism. Display and classified advertising are important ingredients in maintaining healthy circulation and a viable business. The evolution of television news, including 24–hour news stations such as Newsworld and CNN, and the steady advancement of direct-mail advertising, specialty publications and Internet online news services pose a serious challenge to newspapers at the beginning of the 21st century. The Free Press has risen to the challenge, redefining itself as a full-service marketing and communications company and focussing its energy on the things it does best: providing news and information to subscribers along with the marketing reach that comes with the ability to distribute newspapers to an average of 125,000 readers seven days a week, including over 162,000 on Saturday. This has meant redefining the role of the newspaper by creating new sections and overhauling existing ones to ensure the content is focussed on the interests of readers. It has also meant finding better ways to serve advertisers, mostly through the creation of specialty products and supplements tailored to meet the need of the customer. Today’s Free Press is very different from the one published by Luxton and Kenny more than a century ago. However, one thing remains the same: the Free Press’ commitment to quality journalism and its dedication to promoting the intellectual, social and economic growth of the community it serves."

Some of the challenges with the existing technologies are: reliability of wireless communication in harsh environmental conditions; ultra low power communication budget to extend battery life and the cost of internet connectivity. We are trying to address these problems with our technology. Our stand on the IoT standardization debate is simple. The last mile connectivity can not be standardized! The reason being, unlike Internet, the IoT applications are very different. Turning on a bulb requires just one ‘bit’ versus streaming video needs data rates of the order of Mbits/sec. Hence multiple standard-based and proprietary solutions will have to co-exist to address these wide varieties of applications. And this is possible only when standardization happens at the cloud level. This will allow all the connected things to talk to each other, irrespective of their last mile communication protocol. Our endeavour is to showcase this approach with our technology and products. Consumers don’t care about the standards. They care about the experience, utility and cost. We want to provide a seamless experience to our customers - one mobile APP to take care of all their needs. Our plan is to integrate all the existing products, which our customers care about, on to our platform. And build great products, wherever there is a gap. Wish us luck."

WindAlly,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/windally,"Big Data, Enterprise Software, Machine Learning, Renewable Energy, Wind Energy",Modern software for wind asset management. Looking for a seed investment and an opportunity to start a pilot project.,"At what technology stage is our product? Currently, we offer a prototype and we are looking for a pilot project where we will prove the value of our software. We are also looking for 200 000 Euro of a seed investment. What problem are we solving? Currently, European Union experiences a continuous growth in wind power share. Together with aging of present installations, there comes an increasing need for optimal operation and maintenance, and a growing interest in asset lifetime extension. According to IRENA’s report on Generation Costs in Renewable Energy, O&M costs can represent even up to 25% of the Levelized Cost of Electricity. Besides, turbine downtime represents a significant portion of costs too. Some components, like turbine gearbox, break down extremely rarely and it is not financially justified to store them on-site. On the other hand, lack of a part for replacement can cause a turbine a pause in operation for many days or even months, generating monetary losses. On top of that, a single wind turbine produces hundreds of data readings every minute, usually used for manual monitoring and stored on the wind farm. What is our product? A thorough consideration leads to the conclusion that a solution bridging the gap between available data and its easy manipulation is greatly needed. Proper data handling may not only enhance the management of the wind farm but also lead to valuable insights, improving its overall performance. The existing advancements in machine learning and big data analytics allow to unlock the potential of renewables, decreasing their overall costs and improving their integration into the power system. WindAlly is a comprehensive software that gathers and analyses data collected from the wind farm, providing valuable functionalities to all stakeholders engaged in the process of wind asset management. The system offers a broad range of capabilities, including wind turbine failure detection, forecasts of wind energy production, facilitated inventory management as well as maintenance work optimization. Resulting predictive maintenance leads to a smaller number of failures in a wind turbine, therefore increasing the odds for asset lifetime extension. All improvements can generate savings up to €20k per megawatt of wind turbine installed for each year over its lifetime. Concluding, WindAlly is aimed at enhancing the work of wind asset managers, wind operation managers and maintenance team, ultimately decreasing the O&M costs of a wind farm and improving its performance. How does WindAlly work? At WindAlly, we are pursuing a holistic approach to wind farm management. The software that we offer is based on four main components: SCADA integration – by integrating data primarily managed by various SCADA systems, the software is aimed to give an access to powerful and concrete insights coming from the data. Failures detection - machine learning-based algorithms are responsible for early failure detection, thus enabling predictive maintenance and consequent cost reductions. Energy production forecasts - advanced models based on artificial intelligence ensure accurate electricity generation forecasts, increasing the ability to avoid costly under- or over-productions. Inventory management - constant insight into spare components in stock along with an updated comparison of available offers enables optimization and automation of upcoming orders. The combination of energy production and maintenance forecasts empowers the wind farm managers to optimize maintenance works by aligning O&M with low energy production, assuring the least costly operation. Further, reduced number of unexpected failures, together with improved inventory management, allow for a decrease in turbine downtime and resulting cut of expenses. The software’s interface is flexible and simple. It is designed to be tailored for each actor engaged in the process of wind farm management and to provide an easy access to the most important information. Additionally, a compatible architecture of our software allows for an integration of any tools that the user currently works with into the platform, eliminating the need for using multiple systems.  Leveraging leading market solutions like Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure, gives WindAlly virtually unlimited data processing resources. With the use of products like S3, ingestion of large quantities of data is simple and efficient, allowing developers to focus on developing advanced machine learning solutions to provide industry-leading models.
