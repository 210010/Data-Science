Loxo Oncology is committed to bringing targeted cancer therapies rapidly into the clinic that have an opportunity for outsized clinical effects in genetically defined patient populations. Loxo Oncology derives its company name from an attendant of the Greek goddess Artemis, who represented the concept of trajectory in the sport of archery. It is an exciting time to develop cancer drugs. Diagnostic methods are yielding strong clues about which cancer features are actionable, “driver mutations,” in contrast to those merely along for the ride as “passenger mutations.” In the last five years, these insights have transformed the standard of care in melanoma, lung cancer and other cancers. Picking a target is just the first step in building a cancer drug. Good chemists build good drugs. The physical properties of a compound have much to do with its ultimate success or failure. Is it stable? Is it soluble? Is it absorbed? Does it reach its target? Does it engage the target? Does it cause toxicity elsewhere in the body before it achieves maximum efficacy in the cancer? In our opinion, drugs that achieve excellent exposure in the body and are highly specific for their intended targets have the highest chances of success. Once an attractive target is selected and a drug with best-in-class properties is constructed, setting up the right clinical development plan is of utmost importance. Our goal is to generate a clinical path that reflects the underlying scientific hypothesis that made the drug interesting in the first place. This often means developing the drug in a population of patients whose tumors possess a specific genetic vulnerability targeted by the drug. Loxo Oncology was built around a team of full-time professionals and engaged scientific advisors who are aligned in choosing the most actionable targets, and pursuing them through disciplined clinical trial approaches. Our license and collaboration agreement with Array Biopharma and our experienced team allows us to construct drugs with best-in-class properties from the ground up."

"LetinAR Co., Ltd.",https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/letinar-co-ltd,"Augmented Reality, Hardware, Virtual Reality, Wearables",LetinAR is a startup which develops optical solutions for Augmented Reality (AR) Glasses.,"LetinAR develops an optical system for AR smart glasses, which plays the same role as smartphone displays. The optical system consists of LetinAR’s self-developed “Pin Mirror (“PinMR™”) lens” and a microdisplay made by external partners. Current smart glasses manufacturers use traditional optical systems such as Half-mirror, Diffractive Optical Elements (DOEs), and waveguides to build the devices. Under-par performance of those optical systems has hardly satisfied users and experts. The bulky body, narrow Field of View (FOV), complicated manufacturing process, and inaccurate color expression have long been a stumbling block for successful commercialization of AR smart glasses.  LetinAR’s PinMR™” lens is set to replace such displays. The company has applied the so-called “Pinhole Effect” to tiny mirrors and embedded them with eyeglass lenses. Respective PinMR™ reflects the light from a microdisplay and guides the light into human pupils. Users may view the virtual image from the microdisplay as well as the image from the real world at ease. Human eyes cannot detect the mirrors because the mirrors are smaller than human pupils. Only the virtual image formed by the light reflected by those mirrors becomes visual.  With LetinAR PinMR™ lens, smart glasses manufacturers can build smart glasses worn like a pair of conventional glasses. The simple structure of PinMR™ Lens module can facilitate mass production. PinMR™ Lens shows wider virtual screen than the currently available optical systems while more accurately expressing colors – an edge over diffraction-based or refraction-based systems from competitors. PinMR™ Lens can also show a clear image without inducing dizziness because it is able to extend the Depth of Field (DOF) multiple times.  LetinAR plans to supply PinMR™ Lens as a complete module, which consists of PinMR™ lens and a microdisplay from external partners. LetinAR will begin providing PinMR™ Lens samples next year, making it possible for smart glasses manufacturers to evaluate the potential of using PinMR™ lens for their own products.  Based in Seoul, South Korea, the company was founded in October 2016. It has raised $700,000 seed money from Naver, the biggest portal site and search engine operator in South Korea. LetinAR went on to receive $3.6 million in Series A funding from another internet giant, Kakao Ventures."

InternMatch also launched a pared down self-service version of their Campus Hub, allowing smaller students to add rich content and helping make the internship discover process for students on InternMatch more complete. Overall, to support it's college hiring ecosystem LookSharp focuses on three things: First, LookSharp is looking to make the internship search and posting process incredibly simple. On the LookSharp platform both internship seekers and employers can search for a match, receive skill and location based matching recommendations, and access tools to manage the application process. Students can also search and apply to opportunities without registering.   Second, LookSharp has built and continues to construct an evolving library of resources and tools. Students can access tools for resume creation, internship preparation, and more. Organizations can access resources that help with intern management, program development and advice on compensation.  Third, LookSharp has built the infrastructure to help interested students connect with socially responsible positions especially at nonprofit organizations. Rather than volunteer, students recognize the value in experiential learning that combines positive social impact with career building which is a key tenet for LookSharp."

LOCI,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/loci-inc,"Innovation Management, Intellectual Property, Machine Learning, Mapping Services, Marketplace, Navigation, Predictive Analytics, Search Engine, Semantic Search",A company revolutionizing the way we protect our ideas and intellectual property. All with blockchain.,"LOCI’s mission is to disrupt the global patent industry, and to change the way the world invents and values ideas. LOCIcoin utility tokens are used exclusively within the LOCI suite of products for the purposes of searching, analyzing, staking and exchanging Intellectual Property. LOCI Search provides a unique and patented Venn Diagram IP search tool for FREE (https://www.locisearch.com/) LOCI Invention Analysis helps new inventors determine the novelty and demand (undergoing further development) for their ideas before they spend money trying to patent. This is a huge cost savings of about 95% compared to traditional patent attorney searches. LOCI Invention Analysis can also help guide inventors toward “white space” where there are relatively few existing patents, where demand is high, so the inventor has the best possible chance of being awarded a patent, and/or selling their idea. Inventors can submit multiple iterations to help refine their idea and identify alternative applications of their invention. The ultimate goal of the inventor while using Invention Analysis is to achieve a optimal “LOCI Score” which indicates that their idea is unique, and in high demand. Once an inventor has refined their idea to feel confident that it is unique and in high demand, then they will be able to easily translate their idea into a provisional patent application using the LOCI system that is directly filed with the USPTO (in development), as well as stake their claim on the blockchain, which provides an immutable, undisputable time-stamp of the staked idea. This protects the invention for a period of 12 months at a very low cost. Visit https://loci.io for more information!"

Yet, perfectly good applicants are regularly declined due to blemished credit, student status, or other factors that do not impact their ability to pay. That’s where Leap helps. Our proprietary underwriting tools allow for quick and thorough vetting of potential residents which expands a landlord’s pool of qualified tenants and eliminates default risk.  There is no cost to the landlord as the one-time, upfront fee is paid by the resident and secures rental income for the entire term of the lease. Further, Leap accepts applications from tenants before they begin their apartment search, pre-approving them up to a certain monthly rent amount and delivering qualified residents directly to landlords.  Our goal is to improve the financial performance of landlords while helping people qualify for better apartments.   Our application takes 4 minutes to complete and can be submitted on a phone, tablet, or computer, and approvals take just 30 minutes during business hours. Furthermore, Leap can pre-approve renters for a maximum monthly rental amount for free. That way if you haven’t found an apartment yet, it’s easier to know what to look for. With Leap, renters can get the apartment they want, not just the one landlords say they qualify for. No apartment is out of reach, and that is a guarantee.

The issue is that, as humans, we are wired to ask a LOT of questions and our brains work with ambiguity - fresh ideas, new thoughts, a change of mind - all of these things guide our conversations.  But AI still doesn't cope too well with this. In 2009, we began work on a psychological framework that invites you to stand at the center of your own knowledge and experience; understand what's going on inside it; and take action.  Our proprietary psychology platform works through cognitive linguistics and embodied cognition, and is based on Nobel Prize-winning theory. To make this technology accessible to everyone, we have developed our own proprietary communications engine built on Natural Language Understanding (a 'hard' part of Natural Language Processing).  This engine focuses on asking questions as the technology strives to 'understand' what you are looking for.   Whereas AI can be built around large decision trees and statistical probability, our technology is specifically founded on 'not knowing the answer'. Our primary Use Case of this IP is ""Litha"" - the world's first true AI psychotherapist - specialising in speaking with people dealing with anxiety or mild-moderate depression. Litha is able to engage in and transcribe free-flowing unstructured conversations as she guides you through the therapy process. _______________________________________ From an investment perspective, Litha is addressing a $1 trillion global corporate issue of non-productivity due to anxiety or mild-moderate depression (UK market is c. $43bn; USA market is c. $300bn).

However, at present, there are zero products on the market that provide AI psychotherapy. In addition to this, the wider issue of psychological safety in the workplace has causal links to non productivity and innovation.  We are already exploring the financial impact of poor psychological safety and its links to ethics, team cohesion, resistance to change, etc.   Litha is in the latter stages of the Lab and is having unstructured psychotherapy sessions via a Slack Channel as well as via Google Assistant and Alexa.

To achieve ultra high definition resolutions, smartphones and HDTV’s are designed with smaller pixel apertures, which in turn reduce the display brightness. To maintain the brightness, display engineers either use more LED’s to boost the light therefore increasing the power consumption or use thinner optical films including polarizers to re-gain light throughput.  Our lyotropic liquid crystal materials eliminate these major bottlenecks, providing breakthrough, single layer, and thin, coatable polarizers either on substrates or directly on the cell eliminating the substrate using industry standard production processes. The result is a low cost, easy to make, high brightness polarizer that meets the market trends for ultra high resolutions displays."
