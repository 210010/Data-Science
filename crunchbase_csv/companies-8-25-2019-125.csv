When combined with the grid, they will create a hybrid power system that is cheaper, more reliable and much “greener” than the grid alone. YouSolar has the technology and business model to accelerate this transformation. Their first market is India, a country with acute power shortages that is emerging as the largest market for solar+battery systems. If you regularly need backup power and have roof space, YouSolar can provide a complete energy solution at much lower cost than electricity from a diesel generator. You will have reliable, high quality electricity with no switchover during grid outages and plenty of power when turning on appliances. Best of all, they will monitor your system 24/7 and back it up with a 5-year warranty. The worldwide market for solar systems is poised to grow exponentially. India is the hotspot. In July 2015 India announced a goal of 40 GW of power from rooftop solar by 2022 (equivalent to 10 million systems). However, two big challenges must be overcome: How to integrate these systems with the grid, and how to finance them. YouSolar’s solar+battery systems and secure leasing model are the answers. Thanks to this proprietary intelligence, the YouSolar system uses nearly all the solar energy generated by the solar array and, thus, does not have to be “net metered”. The system takes power from the grid, but never sends power to the grid. So, there is no need to get a permit from the utility. YouSolar’s system can remain functioning at all times, unlike net metered systems which must shut down during power cuts (for safety). Being available during power cuts and requiring no permits are big advantages in markets like India."

Needing only a functioning e-mail address, users can quickly download the Yoomba client from the company website, and without any registration can contact other e-mail addresses over chat or VoIP call by clicking one of two buttons that automatically appear next to e-mails in your e-mail client. In order to chat or make calls, however, both users need to have Yoomba: if the other address contacted does not have Yoomba, he/she will get an e-mail directed to Yoomba's download site.  Yoomba is compatible with many e-mail clients inculding GMail, Yahoo Mail, Hotmail, and Outlook.  The service is great because it eliminates the need for phone numbers. Users only need their email account and an email address to make a call or IM.  Now based in Silicon Valley, Yoomba was originally founded in Tel Aviv, Israel as one of the world's first open communications companies.  It faces competition from other more popular services like the IM client [Meebo](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/Meebo) and VoIP company [Skype](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/Skype), which have larger user bases and offer some more features.

Since December the platform has ist first registered beta users. Opinions and recommendations of friends and peer groups are becoming more and more important; those have a huge impact on online shopping decisions. The increasing factor of social networking in everyday life hasnâ€™t found a way yet to integrate this new kind of decision making process. We are facing a transformation from E-commerce to Social Commerce. To optimize the shopping experience within the web, Youdress therefore provides the users with innovative shopping tools as well. Which can be referred to as Virtual Wardrobe, Fashion Advisor, Street Fashion Outfits, Store Locator. Basic idea is that users exchange their knowledge about trends and styling.

Â  Youdress has the aim to make online shopping for fashion more transparent and collaborative. Through unique highlights like creating a virtual wardrobe, people can interact and communicate directly. Users can click through the wardrobes of the community, get inspired, exchange information and clothing or simply sell it to each other.  Online shopping is not a lonesome activity anymore. Use the recommendations and advices given by the community to inform yourself in advance or collect the opinions regarding your previously purchased belongings. Take your friends along on your shopping tour throughout the web.  Â  The 22 year old Founder and CEO, Jonathan GÃ¼nak, had the business idea during college years while observing uncertainties of his colleaguesâ€™ online shopping behaviour. The fact that finding the right articles within the right sizes appeared to be a huge problem regarding the online purchase - without seeing the products in real life â€“ made him draw the conclusion to create a new business concept that optimizes the online shopping on the ground rules of social web. Â  The Youdress GmbH was founded in July 2010. Shareholders are Jonathan GÃ¼nak and GFT Technologies AG. Currently, Youdress employs 5 employees.

The startup lets fantasy players score points and move up in the ranks by choosing what offensive plays will be called next in live football games. Normal fantasy sports leagues base their scoring and ranking on choosing players before games start, but YouBeQB is different because it allows fantasy players to make decisions during games.   Fantasy players have to make decisions before plays actually start. They awarded varying amounts of points depending on the play they choose, with more rare or difficult plays earning more points.   Founder Kris Billmaier used to play an informal version of YouBeQB with friends during football games, but decided to develop it into an actual online game. The company has raised funding from people with football connections including NFL greats Ronnie Lott and Joe Montana. The company plans on developing partnerships with both the NFL and the NCAA."
