The recipes are delivered right to your doorstep once a week so you decide when to cook. Whenever you’re on holiday or just don’t have time, simply place the subscription on hold – it’s easy. Gousto was started in 2011 by two friends who share a passion for food and cooking. In their previous lives, Timo and James loved cooking but didn’t have much time to go to various grocery shops. They found it difficult to cook recipes from online databases or follow cook-along TV shows. Ready-meals from supermarkets do the job but the quality isn’t great, they have lots of additives, and they get boring very easily. One day, James and Timo decided that there must be some way to make life easier and the idea for Gousto was born. The first recipes were offered at market stalls and from there the concept has grown into what you see today. Of course, all of Timo and James' friends are Gousto guinea pigs. Today, Gousto has a team of professional chefs and passionate amateurs (thanks mum), making sure that the recipes cover all cuisines and styles."
