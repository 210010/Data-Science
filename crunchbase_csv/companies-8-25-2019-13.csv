Applications range from EnLighten, which tells drivers when the light they are stopped at will turn green, to vehicle powertrain optimization based on the state of upcoming lights. Safety is their number one priority. They alert drivers to possible dangers without distracting them. For example, EnLighten tells drivers stopped at red lights whether they have time to catch their breath for a few seconds, change the radio station, or pick up the papers that fell on the floor. EnLighten waits until the car stops, so the driver is not distracted, then announces how long the light will be red and gives a visual countdown. A few seconds before the light turns green, an alert sounds to tell the driver to focus on to the road. Another service They are developing warns drivers when they, or another connected vehicle, are about to run a red light. They partner with municipalities, handling the complexities of gathering real-time signal data and making it available in consistent formats for a variety of uses. Unlike other connected-vehicle technologies, their approach requires neither costly municipal infrastructure investments nor the addition of dedicated hardware to every vehicle.

By combining various ideas from the cognitive science, neurology and advanced artificial intelligence programming – Dr. Jensson created the foundation that eventually became Cooori.

And although the company has grown, we’re still paying homage to Mirarchi’s decades-old tradition by making our snacks in small batches at our California facility using healthful ingredients and protein options like grass-fed beef, antibiotic-free turkey, and pork.

He went to Omaha Startup Weekend and it was there that he met Chad Wilken. It was dev at first sight. They hit it off and Chad was quickly hired to develop the app into something magnificent.  Not long after, the development team continued to grow and more and more wizards were brought on to make the app more intuitive, better looking, and overall more impressive.

"Codagenix, Inc.",https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/codagenix-inc,"Biotechnology, Genetics",Codagenix employs a proprietary technology platform for the construction of live attenuated viral vaccines for multiple targets.,"Codagenix Inc. utilizes our breakthrough platform technology termed SAVE to construct live-attenuated viral vaccines against multiple targets. All live-attenuated vaccines that are currently used in the clinic were developed using a trial-and-error based method developed in the 1880s, pre-dating the discovery of the DNA double helix.  Codagenix presents a breakthrough approach to live-attenuated vaccine design- were no longer would a vaccine developer blindly passage their target virus to construct a vaccine.  The SAVE platform relies on synthetic biology and the “re-designing” of a target virus’s entire genome to yield a vaccine strain (Coleman JR. Science 2008; Muller SM. Nature Biotechnology 2010).  This customization process uses software-based algorithms to ‘re-code’ the genome of a target virus.  This genomic ‘re-coding’ results in a virus that is antigenically 100% identical (i.e. looks exactly like the wild-type, virulent strain) but possesses a genome that renders it attenuated in the host.  The proteins of the SAVE-designed vaccine strain are one hundred percent identical to the virulent strain and as a result animals vaccinated with SAVE-designed vaccines develop a robust and protective immune response.   SAVE is a platform technology that has had preliminary success constructing vaccine candidates for multiple, unrelated targets viruses.  SAVE is an up-stream approach to vaccine construction.  The science behind the SAVE ‘re-design’ targets a fundamental process of all viruses and thus it is viewed as platform that could yield a pipeline of candidate vaccine strains against multiple targets that include: Influenza A virus, Dengue Virus, Respiratory Syncytial virus, poliovirus, and others. The first candidate virus in our pipeline is a live-attenuated Influenza A virus vaccine (LAIV), particularly the seasonal 2009 H1N1 Influenza A virus (referred to as “swine flu”).  This candidate of our pipeline has been initially supported by a small business grant for $551,000 from the NIH that is eligible for $3.5 million based on success.  Despite the availability of seasonal vaccines, Influenza still has a substantial impact on human health.  Based on our approach and preclinical findings, Codagenix has the view that once in the market a SAVE-designed LAIV will prove superior to currently available seasonal flu vaccines.  Aside from Influenza spreading around the world in seasonal epidemics, killing thousands of people annually, there is also a fear of a pandemic arising from an avian H5N1strain.  An additional view of Codagenix is that SAVE can offer a rapid design of a highly immunogenic, anti-H5N1 vaccine should the need arise. The majority of seasonal Influenza A vaccines currently in the market at present are mostly composed of inactivated (killed) virus particles that can result in a inadequate immune response.  There is an ever-growing demand in the market for influenza vaccines, thus an improved LAIV could capture significant market share of what is estimated to be a $6 billion market. In the US this market has been growing with compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% and it is projected to retain a CAGR of 9% until 2015, at which the total market value would reach $15 billion.  The current business plan of Codagenix has two focuses – to prepare our LAIV for clinical testing and to further demonstrate that SAVE is a platform technology for vaccine development by expanding our pre-clinical pipeline to include other targets such as Dengue virus and RSV."

As anyone who has ever tried to recover a crashed or hacked website can attest, the ""back-up"" systems of many web hosting providers leave a lot to be desired. The back-ups sound reassuring in theory--you are assured that your data is always ""backed-up"" on a system that is completely separate from the main one and that you'll be able to access it whenever you need it.  When disaster strikes, your site has been hacked or your developer make a simple mistake, you often discover that your backup is hard to access, out-of-date or has been affected by the same event. CodeGuard is unlike ISP-based-backups. Instead of a static snapshot of your site kept by your ISP (hopefully), we use a File Integrity Monitoring system built on a version control system and store site data in the cloud.  CodeGuard backups are stored as the differential between each daily scan of the site; allowing users visibility into what has changed along with the ability to undo changes on their site and restore to a past version in real time, much like Time Machine for Apple OS does for your laptop.   If the current backup solutions for webmasters are lackluster, then the systems that alert webmasters if their site has been hacked are absolutely appalling. Webmasters discover they have been hacked because traffic suddenly disappears, they see a warning message on Google when searching for themselves, or they get an email from a customer complaining about strange behavior.   CodeGuard's differential backup approach revolutionizes hacking detection and remediation. Rather than relying solely upon site scans and comparisons with known threats, we scan files that have been modified since our last backup  This allows us to identify hacking and alert the site owner before they can spread malware, have their links pirated or act as a parasitic host for spammers--and before safe browsing alerts quarantines the site and kills all of the traffic.   In the event a hack or an unauthorized change is detected, webmasters can quickly revert to the last known good version and have their site working in minutes without engaging a developer to remediate the issue."

CoapTech devices will reduce health care costs, and improve safety, quality, patient experience, and access to services around the globe.      Invented by Dr. Tropello, the CoapTech delivers a novel platform technology combining magnetic attraction for device placement guidance, and low-cost, point-of-care ultrasound for visual feedback in diagnostic, interventional and therapeutic procedures.  Strong rare-earth magnets are used to manually guide device placement inside the human body, while real-time, low cost ultrasound provides visual feedback to the clinician to ensure safety.  This platform technology, invented by the company founder, has the potential to disrupt multiple medical procedures, substantially reducing costs while improving safety and patient experience.   Their lead use case, selected because of its low risk, clear FDA pathway, and strong commercial viability, is for the insertion of gastrostomy tubes.  They have defined the use of Coaptive Ultrasound to perform this novel gastrostomy procedure, as Percutaneous Ultrasound Gastrostomy (PUG).  Briefly, PUG is a point-of-care (as opposed to operating room) procedure for inserting gastrostomy tubes which can be quickly and easily performed by non-surgical providers.  It employs readily available medical devices such as ultrasound, feeding tubes, guide-wires and dilators.                                              Current procedures to insert gastrostomy tubes require expensive, inpatient hospital equipment and have high complication rates between 4% and 20%. The need for highly trained surgeons, operating room time, and use of specialized equipment including endoscopes, fluoroscopes and Computed Tomography (CT) scanners, translates into higher consultation costs, greater patient wait times and additional hospital admission costs.
