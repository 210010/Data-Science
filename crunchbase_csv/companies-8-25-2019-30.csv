Foodem,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/foodem,"Delivery, Hospitality, Restaurants","Foodem, a B2B online marketplace, is a trading, BI and process automation solution for the food distribution industry.","Foodem.com is an online trading, business intelligence, and process automation solution for the $670 Billion U.S. wholesale foodservice industry. By enabling Buyers (individual and small restaurant groups and other food service organizations, such as, hotels, schools, hospitals, country clubs, etc.) and Sellers (small and mid-sized distributors, specialty food manufacturers and local farms) to interact on an unprecedented scale and with exceptional ease and efficiency, Foodem.com provides previously unachievable benefits to both parties. For Buyers, Foodem greatly expands the number of distributors they can do business with. Membership is FREE and sign-up takes only about a minute. Using the Company’s proprietary search tools they can establish the price transparency they need to better manage and even reduce their food costs by comparative shopping simultaneously among multiple local suppliers; up to 50 different items into a single search. Available items from all Sellers serving the Buyer’s location are then reflected in the search results sorted according to the Buyer’s preference of price and distance from the Seller, and orders can be placed electronically with multiple Sellers in one transaction. Including specialty food manufacturers and local farms will enhance assortment and delivery options; automating order processing will reduce errors; real-time reporting will improve menu pricing decisions; and GIS web-based technology will allow them to know the origins of the products they buy. Sellers of ALL food categories from meats, seafood, produce, dry goods to paper and cleaning products - any and everything a wholesale establishment needs to run their business - are welcome. Sign-up is easy and it’s free. Because Sellers offerings will be captured in searches by all Buyers on the marketplace, Sellers now have the opportunity to sell to many more customers than they can reach with their limited direct sales force. And Foodem provides the tools, including real-time, customized product catalogs, a unique store-front (URL) that they can market to Buyers and targeted advertising and promotional opportunities, that will increase sales and return on their marketing investment. In addition, automated inventory and pricing updates and an interface with their ERP systems will lower processing costs and increase customer satisfaction; and an expedited payment option will accelerate cash flow and reduce risk of bad debt. Sellers pay Foodem a 2% commission on the orders they receive. As Groupon, Zynga, and Amazon have done, Foodem.com is building the best of breed product in its vertical market by using and enhancing proven open source technologies to offer an open, free trading platform. Several methodologies, algorithms, and unique applications of existing technology are the core of the Company’s intellectual property that will differentiate Foodem.com from competitors and make it difficult for others to duplicate. Search capability, user interface, and product catalog are key points of competition between online marketplaces. Foodem.com has decisive advantages in all three areas, and certain components of its proprietary technology are believed to be patentable, including a two-step process for Sellers to upload 40,000 inventory items in bulk in less than 15 minutes; a one-step process for Sellers to update pricing in bulk; a Localized Smart Decision Engine that enables Buyers to conduct simultaneous searches on up to 50 items among multiple Sellers and place multiple orders with multiple Sellers in a single transaction; and a Master Guide/Order List that shows details of all previously purchased items for quick re-ordering.  Foodem.com began closed Beta testing with select Buyers and Sellers in November 2010. Foodem 2.0 is scheduled to be operational in Q4 2012. All of the original participants have been active since the closed Beta began and, while the Company chose not to recruit other Buyers or Sellers during this time, 225 Buyers and 100 sellers from 32 states have signed-up on their own initiative. The Company’s website and blog receives about 2,000 unique hits/month, with the average visitor spending four minutes on the website, and a stream of offline inquiries has been received from parties searching for a better way of doing business. Simultaneously with the launch of Foodem 2.0 the Company plans to commence commercial operations in the D.C. Metro Area and subsequently expand into other major markets and eventually nationally. The Company will initially serve independent restaurants and small restaurant groups (about 760,000 nationally) on the Buyers’ side and 33,000 small and mid-sized distributors, 2,900 specialty food manufacturers and thousands of local farms. Later customized offerings will be developed for other Buyers, including hotels, country clubs, catering companies, day cares, schools, universities, and expansion into other metropolitan areas. In addition to commissions noted above, other revenues will be derived from developing personalized Seller web stores, advertising; and data analytics (BI) services."

In fact, Followprice is a high quality lead generator for e-commerce stores, taking consumers back to the store, and increase the sales of the online store. We are solving a problem both for consumers and online retailers. On one hand, consumers are reluctant on registering/leaving their email as they are often tired of receiving newsletters and mass mail.  Furthermore, they don’t have a structured and automatic way to be aware of the price changes of their favorite products. At the same time, online retailers don’t have the ability to communicate with their website visitors when they don’t buy or register. In fact, online retailers are spending millions of euros to take consumers to their website, but 90% of these leave no trace, thus being untraceable. Followprice appears as a solution for these problems. For consumers we will not only provide the service of warning about price changes, as we will be SPAM free, as they will only receive notifications about the specific products they are following. For online retailers we will provide a valuable service, by taking interested consumers (high quality leads) back to their website. Followprice is an online platform that provides a “follow price button”, to be integrated on webstores. The Followprice button will be on the page of each product, allowing consumers that click on it to add the product to their Followprice List. Whenever a product in their Followprice List changes its price, all consumers following the product are automatically notified on Facebook or Email. The Followprice List can be accessible through our website (followprice.co), were consumers can see and manage all the products they are following from several stores. In the future, consumers will be able to organize the list as they wish, and even share folders of products with their friends. When consumers click either on the notification or on product on the Followprice List, they are redirected to the product page of the e-commerce store.  Our customers (online retailers) benefit from Followprice as we bring back to their website highly interested consumers, that otherwise would not probably go back there. We are a high quality lead generator for online retailers, not bring new consumers, but bringing consumers that had been on the store at least for one time. We will provide online retailers not only with the service of automatically notifying interested consumers on price changes of the products of their store, but also provide them advanced statistics, social media brand awareness and also the feature of creating specialized notifications (not automatic)."

foosye®,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/foosye,"Android, Developer Tools, Food Trucks, Information Technology, iOS, Mobile, SaaS, Web Apps",We noticed there was no infrastructure supporting the growing $5.9 billion dollar food truck industry. Then we built it!,"Foosye® began in 2014 with a small group of entrepreneurs who had a vision – to eliminate “drive, park and pray” within the mobile food truck industry. The food truck industry has gained significant momentum over the past 5 years, growing from an estimated $650 Million in revenue in 2012 to an estimated $5.9 Billion in 2017. And yet, food truck owners and operators are challenged with balancing demand and supply to achieve profitability. Inspired by Co-Founder Ray Chow, two long-term foodies and an experienced restaurant and food truck owner came together to help solve the drive, park and pray challenge and create a platform that connects the world’s mobile food industry. Our mission is simple: to amplify food truck operations utilizing technology, predictive analytics and IoT on a food truck. By connecting what we believe are 10 unique customer segments into a robust ecosystem, Foosye® will offer an industry-wide platform that enables communication, scalable and repeatable processes and ultimately profitability for this growing industry segment. Foosye® is much more than a technology – it is a platform that connects the mobile food industry.  In 2015, Foosye® filed a patent for our platform technology and processes. Our patent is bigger than just the mobile food industry, and supports all mobile retail. Given the popularity and continued growth of the food industry, mobile food trucks are our primary market entrance. Long-term, the Foosye® platform will be used to enable other mobile vendors, including mobile clothing retailers, pop-up markets, etc. The food truck industry is more robust and dynamic than meets the eye. Ten unique customer segments not only influence and effect the industry, but also represent revenue streams for the Foosye® platform. These segments include: Food Truck Owners		General Public			Advertisers Event Coordinators		Vendors/Suppliers		Commissaries Trade Associations		Government			Municipalities 	 Food Truck Parks & Lots				 Contrary to common misconception, all food trucks are not the same. Each is unique in its capacity to balance marketing and operating a business while taking care of the paying customer at the window. Event coordinators and consumers are also key constituents in the mobile food community; without these there is no demand for the trucks. Foosye® solves this challenge by offering an industry-wide, data-driven platform that allows mobile food truck owners to focus on the customer at the window while leveraging predictive analytics and simple dashboards to make better decisions on when and where to operate their trucks. The Foosye® platform simultaneously allows event coordinators and consumers to engage directly with food trucks. In an increasing mobile society connected via social technologies, the mobile food truck industry is poised to dominate consumer interest over the next 3 to 5 years. By combining a wide variety of dining selections, in a convenient way, that feeds the experiences that today’s consumers value, the food truck industry will only continue to grow and expand. Foosye® is uniquely positioned as THE platform connecting the mobile food supply chain, eliminating “drive, park and pray” for vendors and “where’s lunch?” for consumers. "

It is increasingly easy to modify an existing pathogen to make it more lethal or transmissible, or design new viruses. We are not prepared for surviving a viral pandemic, major electromagnetic pulse (EMP) strike, or other disasters.  Many “survival community” businesses are growing in the United States, offering underground shelter and stockpiled food and emergency supplies to survive societal collapse.  Disaster Preparedness LLC (DP LLC), doing business as “Fortitude Ranch” , offers survival facilities in a different manner than competitors.  Our shelter communities are useful now as hunting, vacation, bed and breakfast, and resort sites:  “Fortitude Ranch: Prepare for the worst, enjoy the present.” This offers far more value to customers and more sales and profit for the business.  We have one location in West Virginia and a small recreation only site in Colorado that will be replaced by a full size Fortitude Ranch (FR) location.  With this small capital raise we will open up FR locations in CO and WI, purchase land for additional locations in NV and TX, and identify land and contractors for a total of 12 FR locations.  We will operate a few locations while waiting for the “Event”—a major media episode or disaster that spurs a jump in awareness of collapse threats and need for survival community protection. When this occurs we will immediately allow only higher margin long term memberships and quickly sell out the 12 FR locations and reap a huge return on investment.  We are an “Antifragile” investment since this capital raise goes primarily to land purchase and low cost buildings, which will likely appreciate in value.  If there never is any “event” that leads to huge sales and profit, our downside is return of capital by selling off our land and multi-purpose buildings."

We help any online retailer that wants to increase customer retention & turn their inventory faster without giving one-size-fits all discounts. We do this by allowing online, automated price negotiation. FOSHO is a machine learning based API that retailers can embed on their site / chatbot and allow shoppers to negotiate. We all know what negotiation means, we have  certainly negotiated when we wanted a better salary or a cheaper car but, we have never experienced the ability to negotiate when we have shopped online! That’s the innovation of FOSHO. Users can negotiate on any product / service by making offers and our smart interface responds with instant, personalised counteroffers! A shopper can negotiate by making multiple offers within 2 minutes till FOSHO agrees on the price. Now shoppers don’t need to waste time on promo codes, cash back options or even waiting for sales seasons. And the online retailer is better off with more sales and happier customers. FOSHO is unique as it even gives you discounts to you in lieu of newsletter subscription, product reviews, waiving return rights, helping maintain retailer’s ROI and other customisable options – which has never been done before!    Fosho does this though its unique negotiation algorithm, which takes pre-defined rules from vendors and then optimises for various parameters real time. The shopper can thus 'negotiate' for price at point-of-sale.  This technology allows vendors to increase their profits without giving the same, flat discount to all.

Well documented investigations are critical, because these days, even a police officer’s sworn testimony is not enough.  More and more, officer actions are questioned and debated.

Contemporaneous notes ensure the officer is seen as credible in the courtroom or during internal investigations.  However, notetaking is only part of the solution.  Forensic Notes also has an Enterprise component that includes a Cybercrime Investigations Management application and Exhibit Management software for Digital & Video Forensics Units.

The first contact during any investigation is often with a witness who may hold valuable electronic evidence on their mobile device. It is critical that officers have the ability to quickly acquire this information and make it available to supervisors and lead investigators so that critical and time-sensitive decisions can be made. This is why we created Forensic Witness. There are almost 18,000 separate Police Agencies in the United States representing over 670,000 sworn members.

Food Cowboy,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/food-cowboy,"Apps, Charity, Food Processing",Food Cowboy uses mobile technology to safely route surplus food from wholesalers and restaurants to food banks and soup kitchens.,"Consumer food waste is largely behavioral but supply chain waste comes down to economics: Food is expensive to move. If it can’t be sold, it doesn’t make sense to preserve or transport it. That is why wholesalers and distributors throw away thousands of tons of wholesome but blemished produce every day – not just because you and I won’t buy it, but because they can’t find charities to donate to in time. Why not? The food supply chain is longer and more technologically interconnected than ever before. But most food charities haven’t progressed beyond spreadsheets and e-mail – their technology capacity is limited. Thus, the terrible irony of food companies paying to have nutritious fruits and vegetables hauled away to landfills, while charities just a few miles away pay good money to purchase the same foods. Food Cowboy helps charities look and act more like supply chain companies. It can help truckers and other donors search for them by location, operating hours, storage capacity and even loading dock type. It can also handle scheduling and communications. Transfers happen efficiently and charitable donation paperwork is streamlined. Right now, the paperwork’s not worth the hassle. There’s no getting around the fact that we are wasteful – yet we are also caring and innovative. In the past, we lacked both the technology and the understanding to do more than just talk about hunger and waste, but now we have real solutions. So let’s partner up to feed our neighbors and protect the environment."

Now they look at manual trading strategies, indicators, brokers, virtual private servers, statement sharing services, and broker rebate programs. The web-site has come a long way since it's original focus was simply Forex robots. Although, this is still the main feature, as it should be. The creators of this site have introduced the world to tremendous trading programs like Forex Fury, and Forex Steam. Fury for over two years, and Steam for over seven years have been providing traders with viable trading opportunities in an automated realm. The most important aspect of the Forex Robot Nation website in 2017 and moving into 2018 is the community. Somehow, PatrickFX has lured many very intelligent readers to this blog over the past seven years, and now their contributions are just as important as the reviews themselves. Many Forex Robot Nation readers provide valuable lessons, strategies and settings that are used to grow accounts on a consistent basis. As the website continues to grow and look to the future, it is mostly focusing on every individual reader. While many blogs want to grow as fast as possible, this isn't the case with FRN. Their main goal is to make sure every single reader they have is successful, and then increase their reader base.

FOSSID detects open source in your code base even if it is not declared in package manifests. They are a team of entrepreneurs that has been working with free and open source software (FOSS) and license management since 2001. They count with vast experience in open source development practices, license compliance and patent protection. After a decade working with FOSS in the corporate world, they gained unique industry insight. They learned to understand the sensitivity with which open source licenses are to be treated, and the complexity involved with license compliance in the modern world, where software developers are as likely to use existing free and open source software as they are to implement their own. Having worked with many existing FOSS management tools for years, they realized that the exponential growth of open source was creating a service gap that no tool could fulfill. As a result, with quality of service and performance in mind, they started building a knowledge base and developing a purpose-made search algorithm that in 2016 became FOSSID, a state-of-the-art FOSS identification solution. They do this because they believe open source is the main pillar of modern software development, and license compliance is the outstanding challenge that it carries."
