Yesware,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/yesware,"CRM, Email, Enterprise Software, Internet","Yesware is an all-in-one sales acceleration platform that helps salespeople connect with prospects, track engagement, and close more deals.","Yesware helps salespeople sell smarter.  Yesware’s Email Tracking notifies salespeople when prospects open their messages and click their links. Custom Templates streamline responses to prospects and customers. CRM Syncing connects sales email to solutions from Salesforce.com, Microsoft Dynamics, and many others to save time and improve the quality of enterprise data. Yesware’s Reports and Analytics give salespeople unprecedented feedback about how their messages are being received.  This is not new technology. They are focused on optimizing proven technology to meet the needs of power users - people who get and send 100 or more emails a day, people who want computers to take on more data-entry and more automation, so that users can focus on building relationships and closing more business. The company's initial target market for B2B salespeople. For these people, a productivity tool that can help them reach their sales goals is extremely valuable. Yesware offers 100 free tracking emails per month to start and you can earn up to 100 additional emails for referring friends, or upgrade to a Plus account with unlimited email tracking. The company also offers Team, Enterprise, and Custom product plans. Learn more at www.yesware.com/plans-and-pricing.  Sales managers who deploy Yesware to their teams see activity-based reports that reveal a new level of performance detail without relying on additional data entry. Yesware’s collaboration features enable salespeople and sales managers to share the most effective templates with their colleagues.  The market for Yesware is huge, and so is the competition. Companies like Salesforce, Microsoft and Oracle sell billions of dollars of enterprise software annually to corporate IT departments. Their software, however, is almost exclusively aimed at sales management and oversight instead of helping salespeople sell more. Yesware sells its services directly to salespeople, and has to prove its worth to them, instead of to an IT or marketing department interested in sales pipeline visibility."

The YES-secure registered members can borrow or lend up to £25,000 for a loan term of 1 to 5 years on a fixed interest rate mutually decided between them. Based on the credit score of the applicant, YES-secure slots the credit applications into six markets (A*, A, B, C, D, E). In addition to borrowers credit scores, lenders can consider various factors such as affordability, stability and Reliability Score TM among others to decide on a suitable interest rate. The risk to lenders is diversified by spreading a loan amount across borrowers with different credit grades and limiting each bid to a miniscule percentage of the loan amount for a non-connection.  YES-secure actively incorporates social networking in its business model by encouraging its members to find, share and evaluate lending opportunities with each other. It uses its Connections feature (friends, family and colleagues) much like other social networking websites to add a viral dimension to the borrowing and lending activity on the platform. Various YES-secure features like peer endorsements and peer groups can go a long way in enhancing the chances of a low cost loan to high-risk borrowers. For lenders, the appeal of the YES-secure community aspect lies in the fact that they can interact with the prospective borrowers as well as in the implied lower default rates. As a responsible social lending platform, YES-secure ensure that the people who form part of its community undergo a strict screening and underwriting process. The senior management team of YES-secure.com Limited brings together a wealth of entrepreneurial, financial IT services and online social media marketing expertise.
