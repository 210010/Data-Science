Two critical problems within the value chain, which are the lack of an access to market for smallholder farmers in the rural areas, which subjected them to activities of exploitative, buying from middlemen and the lack of a coordinated truck delivery system to cart their commodities from farms to markets to sell. AgroCenta’s idea is to solve these age-old problems by introducing an online sales platform that connected smallholder farmers directly to an online market, which has wider geographic size, to sell their commodities. The end result? Exploitative buying was reduced to the barest minimum since farmers were in control of selling their commodities at prices that were favorable to them. Once a farmer gets offers from interested buyers, the problem of logistics and transportation were sorted using AgroCenta’s patent TrucKR solution that allowed the smallholder farmer in any remote village in Ghana access trucks at the click of a button. You can call it the uber for trucks. AgroCenta is changing the very lives of smallholder farmers by using technology to solve problems they encounter in agriculture."

Agricultural Food Systems (AFS) is a company focused on transforming food quality measurement. It seeks to increase value and build trust among agricultural producers, processors, and consumers. AFS offers a new product to assess meat tenderness accurately: the TenderID.  Large beef processors in the United States have the opportunity to earn over $75 million in additional annual revenue by measuring meat tenderness effectively. According to the USDA, “tenderness is the most sought-after guarantee for all levels of the meat industry's sales cycle, & surveys show that consumers are willing to pay a premium for meat that is guaranteed tender.” However, the beef industry hasn't found a way to meet consumer needs yet. This shortcoming means tough beef product remains “a costly & contentious issue for everyone involved in putting meat on the table.” Agricultural Food Systems provides beef processors with the ability to accurately measure beef tenderness so that they can more effectively communicate meat quality to consumers. Additionally, the company’s product, the TenderID, provides processors with an average of $24.40 in additional revenue per carcass. The product gives them the advantages of more efficient processing and consistently accurate tenderness measurements.

Timing is critical and should be set in motion no later than 90 days prior to the move. It is better to complete network due diligence, before the lease is signed.

Unfortunately, there are still barriers to this technique being applied in a ubiquitous manner.

Robotic assistive devices have attempted to alleviate this problem with highly dexterous idevices that are controlled remotely by a surgeon. These instruments provide a surgeon with the same level of dexterity that is available in open surgery, but with many of the advantages that a minimally invasive approach provides. This technology has aided the adoption of laparoscopic techniques in several surgical specialties, most notably in urology and gynecology. Unfortunately, robotic assistive devices lack tactile sensitivity; a surgeon can not feel what he or she is operating on. This brings an added risk of complications, and requires additional training. Additionally, these systems require significant capital for acquisition and maintenance, which decreases their availability to smaller institutions and practices."

Currently, the dominant lead generation model is mostly a lose-lose scenario for the consumer and real estate agent.  This model typically entails the consumer providing their contact info blindly, having no real idea what is being done with it.  Their info is then sold to one or more agents, and the agent pays up front for the lead.  The consumer is then contacted by these agents, all of which they know absolutely nothing about, except that they are probably in close proximity to them.  For the agent, payment is made prior to generating any revenue.  It's likely that the lead will not convert to a deal for the agent.  For the agent, it's a game of chance.  Buy enough leads and if one converts, it more than pays for the leads that didn't.  This model is extremely inefficient with respect to the needs/goals of both the consumer and the agent.  RealEstate.com is closing down their version of this model because it simply is not profitable. By bringing transparency to the interaction between consumer and agent, AgentMatch aims to turn the existing lead generation paradigm on it's head, creating a win-win situation for the consumer and agent.  Consumers are able to thoroughly research agents in their area, using search criteria that includes commission, location, sales history, services offered, experience level, and the estimated value of the home they are selling or buying.  AgentMatch allows consumers to see meaningful data about an agent including number of years licensed, distance from the consumer, number of deals the agent has closed in the last 36 months, the agent's thirty-six month sales history plotted on a map, along with individual transaction details including address, date sold, and selling price, the agent's thirty-six month high, average, and low selling prices, services offered to sellers and buyers, respectively, and the agent's commission and estimated fee based on the consumer's property value.  Consumers decide when they want to talk with an agent by requesting that an agent contact them. Consumers pay nothing for the AgentMatch service, and an agent can only access the consumer's contact info if the consumer requests that the agent contact them.  Agent's pay an industry-standard referral fee of 20% to AgentMatch, only when they have closed a deal involving a lead from AgentMatch. AgentMatch is in the very early stages of it's Beta version, and is currently focusing on growing membership in California."

Agora Media Ltd.,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/agora-media-group,"Finance, Information Technology, Publishing","WELCOME TO AGORA MEDIA... We are a Blockchain Media publishing company located in London, England","At Agora Media we innovate, build and create products and formats that align with the Future of Television - from Transmedia to Social TV... from Multiplatform Engagement to TV Apps, Smart/Connected TV and advanced Game Mechanics - We live, work and play on the cutting edge of entertainment. Transmedia and Factual Formats As Creative Technologists, Transmedia Storytelling, the technique of understanding how to carry the narrative across multiple platforms and formats using digital technologies,  is part of our DNA. We understand fully numerous technologies and have worked both with our own formats and others. From Second Screen to 360 degree video and other technologies, we have a global network of vendors with cutting-edge technologies. Second Screen and Multiplatform Engagement Having worked with, and been an influence on leading second screen platforms such as zeebox, Ex Machina Games and others, we understand the nuances and differences between the major players and can ensure that you make the right decisions when moving into the space. While all current trends indicate that TV and advertising spend are still vital components of the media marketplace, TV viewership does face a number of challenges, including fragmentation, technology-enabled time shifting, and the disruption of media stacking or mobile/tablet multitasking. We are fully versed in this new world – and have built a global network and thought leadership since 2010 at TV App Market. Connected and Smart TV Apps Agora Media and Pixengo Media teamed up making the finals of the UK Technology Strategy Board’s £1 million Tech City Launchpad competition creating the UK’s first travel and destination marketing channel for connected tv with HD Video-On-Demand and high resolution images perfect for the 10-foot, lean-back living room experience – and fully utilised Second Screen, Social TV technologies to provide platform for easy booking and additional content via the web. We planned to monetise by forming partnerships with travel agents, tour operators and activity and entertainment companies in each destination on revenue share deals. We have excellent relationships with Samsung, LG, Sony,  Opera, The Smart TV Alliance and numerous TV App vendors. Social TV The rise of the second screen and it’s integration with Social Media has helped drive some stunning numbers.  In the US, 88% use TV & internet simultaneously once a month (Nielsen) and some 50% do so every day (Google/Clustalabs),  44% of total tablet usage is while watching TV (Nielsen),  72% of under 25’s in the UK comment on programs via social networks (Digital Clarity) and some 62% of TV viewers pick up the phone as soon as TV advertising break starts. (Nielsen). As pioneers in the Social TV movement, from guest lecturing at MIT Media Lab to working with the likes of the BBC, RTL, NPO, Eurosport, NBCU and other broadcasters as well as production companies and brands, we have a deep understanding of the new technologies and can design systems using multiple vendors (ensuring the best of breed) to create the ultimate in Social TV. Video on Demand (VOD) and TV Everywhere Having worked on a number of VOD projects and TV Everywhere including Lovefilm and two startups, we have close contacts with companies such as Kit Digital, BeeSmart, The Connected Marketplace, Connect TV, Neulion and more. From number crunching CDN costs, to designing systems that work on all devices – phone, tablet, TV, STB and PC – we have worked with some of the best. It’s clear that consumers want to watch TV they want, when they want it, on any device they want it one, where ever they are, and we are capable of designing and delivering from both low end STB solutions to advanced TV Everywhere architecture with EPGs that can deliver both live and VOD. Education Seminars and Consulting As instructors for Future TV with Perpetual Solutions in London, working with numerous departments of British Telecom, and guest lecturing at MIT Media Lab and various universities in the UK and Netherlands… we have designed both a half day and full day courses to share our market intelligence. We have been speaking at events on the future of TV since 2010 in London, Cannes, Sheffield, Amsterdam, Hollywood, Groningen (TEDx), San Francisco, San Jose, Madrid, Liepzig, Vienna, NYC, Rio, Copenhagen, Hilversum, Belfast, Berlin, Brussels, Brighton and beyond and worked with broadcasters around the globe such as the BBC, NPO, RTL, Eurosport, NBCU, ITV, RTL and others with media convergence strategies – particularly around Social TV and Second Screen. Branded Content and Product Placement Having worked with many of the world’s leading global brands, Gary Johnson has played a vital role to numerous renowned Hollywood movies such as I-Robot, Ironman, The Dark knight, 2012, fast furious, Kill Bill and Mr & Mrs Smith through product placement and product endorsements. Developments in technology are impacting TV advertising effectiveness and the dramatic rise of connected mobile devices is leading to an increasingly distracted use of TV. Digital technology has also accelerated ad avoidance through time shifting and on-demand viewing, and has enabled a significant amount of fragmentation due to sheer volume of content and niche. All these developments work together to degrade the value of TV ads and are deeply affecting the TV industry as scarcity is removed due to IP delivered content. Innovation is what will save the industry… And Branded Content, though nothing new (Soap Operas were backed by soap companies back in the 50s), brands such as Red Bull are changing the game. And we combine our creative and technology skills in Future TV and global network to help brands find new ways to engage with audiences."

But this does not take into account the inter-dependencies of the variables effect on each other, the effect of the timing and order of the variables occurring along with the sampling sizes that effect outcomes. Agilis Analytics create complex relationships among variables, recognizing that timing and relationships of variables need to be accounted for in the modeling. Our analytics are self-learning programs and process more than 15 billion events per day.
