OrphoMed,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/orphomed,"Biotechnology, Medical, Pharmaceutical",OrphoMed is a San Francisco Bay Area pharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel,"OrphoMed is a San Francisco Bay Area pharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel first-in-class therapeutic dimer conjugates based on its proprietary DIMERx™ platform technology. The company is leveraging its DIMERx™ technology to address the problem of visceral hypersensitivity and pancreatitis in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders and the unmet medical needs in the treatment of both peripheral neuropathic and systemic nociceptive pain. The lead candidate ORP-101 is a peripherally acting sodium ion channel blocker (Nav 1.7), mu agonist/kappa antagonist dimer. The molecule does not cross the blood brain barrier and, unlike other opioids that constrict the sphincter of Oddi, ORP-101, when given intravenously in animal studies, has instead been shown to relax the sphincter. The former attribute implies no abuse potential and the latter minimizes the risks of pancreatitis and/or abdominal pain related to sphincter of Oddi constriction. These two attributes, in combination with the well-understood pharmacology of ORP-101, make the molecule a suitable candidate for chronic treatment of conditions associated with visceral and somatic hypersensitivity and hyperalgesia. Therefore we have positioned ORP-101 for two non-overlapping indications: the oral form for colonic hyperalgesia and gastric dysmotility in IBS-D and the parenteral form for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. The potential clinical benefits are backed by compelling data from validated animal models. The company is also developing potent non-opioid and opioid conjugates to treat acute and chronic nociceptive pain. The non-opioid analgesic conjugate is designed to be non-ulcerogenic and liver-safe and, therefore, has the potential to reshape the pain market served by acetaminophen and NSAIDs. Similarly, the opioid conjugate is designed to be orally active and have a lower potential for dependence than currently available opioids. DIMERx™ technology results in conjugates designed to preserve the receptor pharmacology of their individual constituents, but to have therapeutic profiles well suited for different clinical indications. The components of the conjugates have all been previously proven to be safe and effective for other indications and, therefore, the conjugates have reduced developmental risks. The DIMERx™ conjugates are considered to be new molecular entities and have composition of matter intellectual property protection."

Orgenesis employs a molecular and cellular approach directed at converting liver cells into functional insulin-producing cells as a treatment for diabetes. This new therapeutic approach is called Autologous Insulin Producing (AIP) cell transplantation. Beta cell replacement is one of the most promising approaches for treatment of Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM). Currently, pancreas islet transplantation is the only approved cell replacement technology and it's the best available treatment for diabetics. However, it's impractical because of a shortage of donor tissue and rejection rate by the patient' immune system. Orgenesis believes that converting the diabetic patients own tissue to insulin producing cells will overcome the problem of donor shortage. Moreover, since the diabetic patient serves as his/her own donor, there is no risk of transplant rejection. Orgenesis has manifested promising results in in-vitro and in-vivo studies using human liver tissues. Based on this significant discovery and these findings, Orgenesis has designed an efficient and clear work-plan to initiate clinical testing in the next few months allowing the company to launch phase I clinical trials following FDA guidelines followed by the launch of Phase II clinical trials within a year."

After my 15+ years working for others and running Companies in the natural and organic food space, I realized all of the layers of markup in traditional distribution very simply lead to inflated prices on high quality products. Our model harnesses the awareness and appetite developed by our competitors marketing efforts, and then captures their customers directly when that same consumer looks for value. A simple analogy is as follows: A consumer goes to Whole Foods, decides they want to try chia seeds, and they buy them in an 8oz bag at Whole Foods. They pay $9-12 for this bag (or more). That same consumer decides they like chia seeds, but that to have them as an every day item in their cupboard is price prohibitive at $12-$24/lb. This consumer goes online and searches for a better value. We deliver the right size at the right pricepoint, all while maintaining healthy margins since we are the importer, packager, and direct to the consumer retailer. Additionally, we have favorable cash cycles since we are prepaid rather than assuming any credit risk and waiting for 30-60 days for payment. Finally, our bag of tricks in the eCommerce trade - specifically Amazon - allow us to rapidly achieve top 20 status in virtually any category and then sustain those positions ensuring a continuous residual order flow on all items."

OrienteMe,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/orienteme,"Alternative Medicine, Health Care, Personal Health, Therapeutics, Wellness","OrienteMe is an online therapy platform that provides the best therapist for each patient, available every day.","OrienteMe is an online therapy platform that provides the best therapist for each patient, available every day. Only 2% of Brazilian adults do therapy. Studies indicate that there are at least 9 times more people interested in this practice. Therapy is inaccessible to many because of: cost (suggested price of a one-hour session is over $ 100), access (locomotion and time spent may be infeasible), stigma (perception of weakness), and compatibility (finding a suitable therapist can be difficult). OrienteMe introduces an innovative application that finds the most compatible therapist for every patient (compatibility), available every day from any smartphone or computer (access), costing less than the suggested price of two conventional therapy sessions (cost) and providing an environment anonymous and encrypted (free of stigma). The service is asynchronous, so the patient can send text, audio, image and video and the therapist will respond within 24 hours. Did not you like the therapist? Ask for the change and in 24 hours you will have a new therapist."
