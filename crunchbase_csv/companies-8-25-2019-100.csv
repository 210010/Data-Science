Delivered.,"We provide insurers, their health providers and customers a health platform to optimise rehabilitation from injury, assist in the prevention of injury and chronic disease comorbidities such as arthritis, diabetes, heart disease and mental health disorders, and facilitate the ongoing self management of health. Problem: Delayed intervention, suboptimal healthcare, lack of trusted information, and adverse lifestyle factors are key reasons why patients have ongoing musculoskeletal conditions (e.g. neck and low back pain) and develop chronic diseases. 83% of health insurer outgoings are spent on claims, making them reliant on customers achieving timely recovery from ill health and maintenance of good health in order to remain financially viable. The insurer currently has limited ability to influence this as they are disconnected from their customers. Solution: TrackActive will provide an exercise rehabilitation, early intervention, and prevention application, incorporating wearable technology and behavioural science, to address the needs of customers with, or at risk of, musculoskeletal conditions and chronic diseases. This will decrease reliance on health providers and reduce claims costs. It will compliment the existing TrackActive rehabilitation platform to be a complete self management solution for the customer. TrackActive may also improve satisfaction and retention of customers with their insurer. Traction: The TrackActive rehabilitation platform was developed and launched in March 2015. An Australian Government grant, 26 000 patients across 11 countries, 70 data parameters, a content licencing partnership with Johnson & Johnson, and early relationships with insurers highlights the ability of TrackActive to deliver effective digital healthcare solutions. Competitive Advantage: TrackActive has acquired unique knowledge through extensive exercise research reviews and intelligence from two years of data collection to expand its offering to ‘self service’ early intervention and prevention solutions for insurance customers. Additionally, as rehabilitation can act as a trigger to lifestyle change and ongoing wellness in patients, TrackActive is well positioned to own this customer experience due to the traction achieved with its existing rehabilitation platform. Revenue Model: TrackActive will charge a fee to insurers based on the number of active customers using the application and access levels to data insights. TrackActive also currently receives subscription revenue from health clinics using the rehabilitation platform, as well as content licencing fees with third party, non-competing organisations."

Treamer,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/treamer,"Apps, Employment, Outsourcing","Treamer is a digital staffing platform, revolutionizing the staffing industry with a power of network and smart HR technology","Treamer was founded in 2015 by startup veterans Peter Sazonov, Maija Itkonen, Matias Mäkitalo and Miikka Mäkitalo with the vision of creating a new fast-paced but fair marketplace for jobs. All started in Jyväskylä, at the home of Matias Mäkitalo. Matias had wondered how to help young people to find work more easily and participated in entrepreneur event hosted by Bruce Oreck back in November 2014 at the US Embassy. There, Matias pitched a concept of a digital service for young people to find local small jobs and thus take their first steps into working life. One of the listeners was Maija Itkonen, a serial entrepreneur who understood the huge potential of the idea. Maija immediately contacted her colleague Peter Sazonov with whom she had successfully built a company called Powerkiss. Maija was now proposing something new, a startup with a great business opportunity but also solving major social challenges.  Peter remembered still very vividly the challenges young people are facing when looking for their first work experience, especially with a foreign background. Peter saw in Treamer an opportunity to create a new service that could change lives. Miikka Mäkitalo, brother of Matias joined the team and Treamer was born. The service was released in the spring of 2016, and soon became a hit among small and medium-sized companies looking for new ways to replace the old-fashioned but very needed staffing services.  Today, there are hundreds of people working through Treamer each month and 2018 sales forecasts are exceeding €1 million. Our vision is to be the Europe's leading digital staffing platform. EASIEST WAY TO HIRE TEMP WORKERS Today, most of the work ordered through Treamer is casual day labour - staff for events, promotions, maintenance, warehousing and assistive office tasks. Treamer has become very popular among students, immigrants and other people used to working through staffing agencies. Treamer has digitized the structure of the staffing services by creating smart matchmaking technology and getting rid of unnecessary operational structures.  Given the brilliant staffing technology developed, Treamer allows the companies to find temp staff even for a few hours of work as well as for a few weeks - in just a matter of minutes. HERE’S HOW DEMAND AND SUPPLY MEET The service is very easy to take into use. In practice, a person who wants to work through Treamer downloads the application to either iPhone or Android, fills the required information for himself and verifies his/her identity. After that, he is ready to take open jobs in his own area that fit his profile. When businesses are looking for staff, they publish their available jobs on the service. Workers apply for the jobs and the business selects the most suitable candidates based on their profiles. They can interview candidates, chat, review and pay the salary, all inside the Treamer application. The reviews are in the core of the personal career path - each and every shift is reviewed. The reviews work as a direct feedback but more importantly, as a digital CV. With the help of the reviews, workers can ensure that the businesses hiring them can see how well the have been working in the past. With good reviews, one can be hired for work that might otherwise be out of their reach. With the help of technology, we can provide incredible opportunities for both businesses and the workers, being fair for everyone. For companies, it is quick and easy to hire shift workers, because Treamer handles all the costs and bureaucracy for them. RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYMENT, BRILLIANT CAREER STORIES All work done through Treamer is under official employment contracts following the local labour laws. Treamer automatically ensures that the pensions, taxes and social contributions are paid accordingly. After each completed work shift, both parties automatically receive proof of work and payment certificates to their email. Over 10,000 employees have signed up to the service from all over Finland. Treamer is something different: mobile, easy to use and thus lowers the threshold of participating even in short-term jobs. Because of the nature of the service, Treamer is encouraging people to work. The beauty of the digital work placement is in its democratic essence. 0 and 1 do not take a stand on where you come from, but to who you want to be. Treamer gives everyone the opportunity to prove their skills in the labor market. During Treamers short history, we have created incredible career success stories and one of our missions is to simply bring good to the world. Technology can make job placement and shift working more transparent and fair for everyone. Everyone wins when they are in Treamer."

Travera,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/travera,Biotechnology,Travera is using a breakthrough technology to measure which cancer drugs work against each individual’s unique cancer cells.,"Travera was founded in 2017 to commercialize a breakthrough measurement technology and biomarker developed in the Manalis Laboratory in the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT.  The core technology, a MEMS device called the Suspended Microchannel Resonator (SMR), is an exquisitely sensitive scale that can measure a small change in the weight of a single cancer cell. When cancer cells respond to cancer drugs, they start their process of dying by changing weight in just a few hours. The SMR can detect this tiny weight change.  As most cancer cells die naturally within 1-2 days of being removed from the human body, speed is critical to distinguish between natural cell death and cell death induced by a cancer drug.  It is this exquisite sensitivity that enables the SMR to detect a cancer cell’s response to a cancer drug while it is still a viable cell."

Relationships matter. Sometimes in the hi-tech world they live in today, it’s easy to forget that. But they have always been keenly aware that the point of a good CRM system is to help build better relationships, and that all of their features should meet that criteria. After years of success in the recruitment industry, the founders of TrackerRMS grew increasingly frustrated that the CRM systems available in the market weren’t really built from a recruitment industry insider’s perspective.  There were a lot of venture-funded CRM platforms targeting the industry with big investments backing them, but none of them really seemed to ‘get’ the business from the perspective of someone that was actually in the trenches of the industry every day. So after six successful years of owning and running a recruitment business, David Alonso decided to sell and form TrackerRMS with Andy Jones, committed to building a CRM that is 100% focused on the recruitment industry, and has equal focus on relationships and the bottom line.  Their mutual passion for recruitment and building better business systems provided the fuel to get TrackerRMS started, and they quickly launched their initial product with good traction straight away.  Customers understood that the founders of TrackerRMS knew the market well, and realized that their personal experience helped build a product that would work for recruiters as well as business owners.  At TrackerRMS, their team is committed to always remembering that relationships are the foundation of success for their customers.  Their vision is to continue to support the SMB space and to help them grow their recruitment businesses by using TrackerRMS to build better relationships and to run their operations more effectively--the end result being increased growth and profitability, which is what their customers are all ultimately after."

Trillenium,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/trillenium,"Augmented Reality, E-Commerce, Shopping",Trillenium offers retail sector with solutions to deliver and commercialize augmented reality images.,"The BIG problem preventing AR from entering retail is the production of high-quality 3D image which vendors find complex and cumbersome. Currently it takes dozens of hours for a 3D modeller to fix a photogrammetry model. Lack of 3D rendering that is both easy and cost-effective is a serious showstopper. Trillenium solution bursts through the blockage. Here’s a use case: Consider a typical millennial shopper, she’s considering buying shoes and, of course; she’s going to reach for her phone. Here’s the ideal solution for *BOTH* her and the retailer: Once at a retailer’s site, she picks a shoe and then points her phone at her feet, swiping through shoes, each one actually appearing on her foot, as if she had physically laced one up. (Note: That effect is AR at work.) That interaction so effective that it will add a new verb to retailing vocabulary – to Trill – as in ‘Trill that blouse’ when a retailer wants to show how that item will look on buyer or ‘I trilled pants and bought this pair’ from buyer to friend. A combination of process automation and machine learning to completely remove manual corrections on AR images. Currently it can take from 6-120 hours for a 3d modeller to fix a photogrammetry model. Trillenium’s solution is based on dozens of high-end, professional cameras placed around the product, taking images and uploading them to cloud. Trillenium processes all the information and generates 3d images that are BOTH: highly accurate and lower priced by a factor of 20, so from $200 to $10. Trillenium has two endorsements from iconic fashion retailers. Ted Baker has agreed to install our scanners into their production studio on a 3-month trial period and to pay $10 for each AR image after the trial period. And we also have ASOS, one of the biggest fashion online stores in the world (88 million unique visitors per month).

While other vendors define quality environments as those that simply lack safety concerns, Trust Metrics goes deeper and looks at content for quality features including freshness of content, page design, user experience, depth and breadth of editorial, and hundreds of other unique features to generate an overall quality score and safety ratings. Achieving this work through a combination of machine and human analysis, our ratings provide the much-needed insight for advertisers who simply don't have the resources to evaluate and monitor tens of thousands of domains on their own. Each Advertiser has different thresholds of suitability in quality, safety, and contextual targeting and we use our scoring system to create custom scalable whitelists that help provide more confidence to buying at scale."

Transship Corp LLC,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/transship-corp-llc,"Automotive, Blockchain, Information Technology, Logistics, Supply Chain Management",B2B and SaaS company. Our platform outsources all of the logistics of international shipments of perishable goods. ,"Transship is an automated freight forwarding platform that will disrupt the international shipping of perishable goods industry. Every day thousands of containers are shipped all across the globe. The time required is disproportionate to the actual work that is required to process these shipments. Numerous phone calls, emails and even faxes are required in order to process one shipment. This requires a lot of time and labor and costs a lot of money. Trying to track shipments is nearly impossible. The frustration level for both the shipper and the vendors is always at an all time high. Transship's platform is B2B and IoT. The User (shipper) simply has to upload required information such as what they are shipping, when, where, consignee as well as required documentation. On the back end, Transship will communicate with all the vendors via EDI/API and blockchain technology. This will not only speed up the processing of every shipment, but will also make it more efficient and require less labor. End result is a cost savings for the vendors and the shippers.  Each shipment processed through Transship will have a tracking device provided by Sensor Transport. This will allow every User to know exactly where their shipment is, real time updates and real time temperature readings. Transship also has an agreement with TradeLens to use their API and blockchain technology on our site.  Transship will replace all outdated freight forwarders with modern day technology that is so sorely lacking in the logistics industry. Transship will serve the global marketplace with the ability to process shipments from anywhere around the world. Transship will do to international shipments of perishable goods what Fed Ex and UPS did to parcel shipments; more efficient, more accessible and more cost effective. Transship is currently seeking $1 in seed funding."
