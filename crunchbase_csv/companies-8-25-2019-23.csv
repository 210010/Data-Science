eCoach,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ecoach,"E-Learning, SaaS, Software",An LMS. An Authoring Tool. Combined.,"eCoach is an Australian company offering a cloud-based SaaS platform designed to simplify online training for businesses to create and share learning content.  Following rapid growth and strong product differentiation, the company has set a strategic plan to capture a largely untapped segment of the US market. Founded in 2015, eCoach was borne out of an eLearning business with over 10 years experience in designing and delivering online training, and was created to solve a previously unaddressed corporate pain point where it was difficult and expensive to create and share learning content. The first of its kind, eCoach combines the creation and delivery of online training to provide an affordable, intuitive method for businesses to enhance staff performance and engagement. It is currently based in Newcastle, NSW, with a staff presence across Sydney and Melbourne and an expanding presence in the United States. eCoach is revolutionising the corporate training market by making eLearning available to businesses who have previously been unable to train online due to high costs and complexity. Its affordable pricing and ease of use enables any business to create training resources using drag and drop design tools, deliver content on any device, and gather granular reporting and insights to improve training results, as well as managing and reporting compliance. This allows the company access to businesses who have previously been unable to utilise eLearning.  Most notably when compared to the market, eCoach’s offering allows clients to self-publish interactive training content without the need for external expertise due to the intuitive nature of the technology for loading customised training resources. Very few LMSs (Learning Management Systems) offer the ability to create content; those that do, offer limited feature sets and do not allow for the creation of truly interactive content. Research shows that bite size, interactive training content that is contextually relevant to a business leads to significantly better employee outcomes. This company is well positioned to take advantage of these industry trends, particularly in the United States. eCoach has a strong focus on customer success, placing an emphasis on onboarding new clients and maintaining customer relationships to ensure longevity of product adoption. This approach is atypical in an industry that traditionally offers limited customer support, and has led to a retention rate higher than 98.5%. This approach was awarded recently, when the company was voted the best LMS in the world for customer experience by an industry body."

The blockage of the receptor activity prevents the transmission of the octopamine signals, which delivers quick knock down, kill and repellency against a wide variety of household pests such as cockroaches, ants, dust mites, flies, wasps, spiders, crickets, and fleas.

Eclector,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/eclector,"Advertising, E-Commerce, Non Profit","Eclector develops tools that enable its clients to build shared-profit, online marketplaces for books.","Eclector provides its clients, free, with the tools for them to build shared-profit, online market places—initially with books—for their communities.  The business model is scalable to global proportions — it will work wherever drop-shipping suppliers operate. Initially it provides free, customisable, online bookshops for its charity, business, voluntary group, blogger, school and university clients, sourcing the platform's several million books from the largest UK wholesalers and publishers. Profits on all sales are shared fifty/fifty with clients. Eclector 3.0, whose most important component is a Build-Your-Own-Shop facility, was launched in early July 2010. This makes it quick, intuitive and easy for anyone to build their own shop, thus opening up the huge market for smaller organisations, bloggers and social networkers. Eclector 3.0 has also added millions of second-hand books to the catalogue, while enabling shop owners to sell and fulfill their own titles. As of July 15th, sixty clients have signed up, including small and large charities, the Ramblers, Future Publishing, Vetstream (an international resource for vets), several SMEs including sites for toy collectors, model plane enthusiasts and horse owners, a couple of schools, and the Institutes of Mechanical Engineering and Knowledge Transfer.   Initial client testing started to produce revenues in November 2009. The Company owns the IP in the platform it continues to develop. The business is cash-positive and virtual: its orders are purchased after customers have paid for them and after they have been drop shipped by the Company's suppliers. Eclector exploits the strength of niche affiliate marketing methods within the broader book market. The Internet book market is predicted to be worth £663m in 2010; £1.19 billion in 2014 (Verdict Research). Of the 28.5m people in the UK who bought an average of 12 books, 4.7m did so online. Addressable UK markets of potential clients in six different sectors have been identified, which at conservative estimates are worth £179m per annum to the business. The initial route to market uses a compelling sales proposition that ensures early penetration of the Company's niche marketplaces. 1) Clients are supplied, free of charge, with an e-commerce bookshop, customised for their audience and filled with three million books. 2) Clients are then assisted to market this service to their supporters. 3) Clients are given 50% of the profits earned on every book sold through their shop (that's Â£2 on an average £10 book) — not limited by cookies and as much as five times more than Amazon affiliates earn. The founder, William Pryor, has built a management team that have extensive experience of the book trade, building and managing large scale web platforms, marketing and managing rapid growth. They recognise that as the business grows, they will need to augment their skills and experience with some key additions to the team, primarily in e-marketing and larger scale internet platforms."

They’ve been watching the personal audio industry for years, researching and analyzing everything from the types of music people listen to, how and where they listen, and, most importantly, the quality of audio that they’ve become accustomed to. What they’ve seen has excited, confused, and disappointed us, all at once. Portable audio has revolutionized the way they listen to music, and has transformed the types of products they use. Smartphones and the introduction of music streaming services have made music available to anyone, anytime, anywhere. There are a lot of fashion-oriented headphones and audio players out there. Most sound mediocre, are built like dollar store toys, or are just way, way too expensive. But… There can be no denying that the quality of what they hear when they plug earbuds into their phones is not what they really feel like they should be hearing, and it certainly doesn’t make us feel the same way they feel when they hear live music, or listen to it on a high quality sound system. Or all three. They’ve founded Echobox to help personal audio evolve to a level that does justice to good music. They plan on making good sounding audio products that are well-built and available at prices that are affordable to anyone who is passionate about music. Their first two products, the Explorer and the Finder, are designed to make real high-fidelity audio affordable. In November 2015, they launched a campaign on the crowdfunding website IndieGoGo with the hopes of raising $25,000 to finish the production of their HiFi audio player, the Explorer. With the amazing support of nearly 400 backers, they ended up raising over $70,000! This incredible success has allowed us to move forward even faster with their development, and the Explorer is on track to be finished and market ready by April, 2016. In the meantime, they have delivered (on time) all Finder earphones backed during the initial campaign, and have received overwhelmingly positive feedback about their sound, design and build quality. T could not be any happier! They founded this company because of their love for music, and that passion has pushed us to have plans beyond just making these products. They are a company with a global vision ; a vision of a future where everyone can appreciate music the way it’s meant to be appreciated, both by listening and playing. They want to use their products, and all of their resources, to spread the love of music to as many people as possible!"

That is why we are focusing our energy on completely rethinking and re-designing how the new generation of building materials is made. Ecovon are developing sustainably sourced, newly engineered wood made from coconut husk and sugar cane bagasse, supplying the global market with a formaldehyde-free bio-based wood alternative that are better for people and planet. Ecovon will bring the first non-additive, bio-based, renewable wood product to market which is naturally flame retardant and anti-fungal without added binders (glues). The physical properties are better than comparable engineered woods on the market currently, all which use additives and heavy chemicals to reach additional flame retardant properties while reducing our CO2 footprint, deforestation and enriching the lives of locals in coconut and sugarcane producing developing countries such as Ghana. The board material has been shown to exhibit excellent properties, which are comparable with or even superior to commercial wood based panels. Our product is stronger and more durable, priced considerably less, and greener. Coconut husk has the highest lignin content of any known plant and this helps the raw material to bind into a hard board without the addition of any damaging glue or binder. Due to its strength the board has the potential to be used for structural elements in buildings. It also has natural anti-fungal properties and burns three times slower than wood. The method is sustainable and environmentally friendly. The residual material of the coconut is used in its entirety. It is a good alternative to wood and helps to prevent deforestation. During production, glue and chemical agents do not need to be added. Furthermore, the production is CO2 neutral. It is inexpensive. The glue that has to be added when boards based on wood fibre are made contributes to one third of the total production costs. Glue is not required to process coconut husk into board material. It can form an extra source of income for farmers in developing countries"

Itâ€:tm:s also an option for people who have to pay for curb-side recycling or who want to have their recyclables picked up when and where they desire. For non-traditional materials (tennis balls, wine bottle corks, eyeglasses, et al.) ecycler offers the opportunity to recycle these items that are not usually recyclable via local recycling centers. Two types of recyclers will use the site: the â€œdiscardersâ€ and the â€œcollectors.â€ Discarders will be individuals located at a residence, business or organization who are interested in timely and free removal of recyclables. Collectors, the entrepreneurs, will be individuals, businesses or organizations that are interested creating a network of discarders that will provide them with recyclables that they can redeem for cash. Discarders enter into ecycler.com that they have recyclables available for pickup and the site links them to collectors in their area. After a pickup is arranged, the discarders place their recyclables in the pickup location (curb, end of driveway).  In many cities and towns, there is no municipal curb-side recycling program, therefore making it inconvenient for people to recycle.  Even in cities that do have such programs, there is an incentive for people to use ecycler.com because they can arrange to have their recyclables picked up when itâ€:tm:s convenient for them, rather than on the cityâ€:tm:s schedule. Also, discarders who use ecycler.com help foster entrepreneurship in the community.

Discarders can also make money by choosing not to give away their recyclables for free, but to request a portion of recyclablesâ€:tm: estimated value.  The site also allows discarders to measure how green they are by tracking the amount of recyclables they give away through ecycler.com and on their own."
