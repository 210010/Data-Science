Nickel Labs,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nickel-labs,"Children, Food Processing, Restaurants",Nickel is an allowance manager for kids to gain real-world experience with money.,"The Internet is changing money—how they access it, spend it and manage it. E-commerce and mobile payments have taken virtually all of the friction out of spending, making it much easier to spend money without much thinking. Their children are growing up in this brave new economy. In this complex, ever-evolving world of money one thing never changes: the importance of teaching their kids the value of a dollar. How can they, as parents, help educate their children about making smart spending and saving decisions? By rethinking allowance. It’s time for their children’s allowance to catch up with the digital economy. It’s time to talk to their kids about money, and empower them with the tools to shape a lifetime of financial well-being. It’s time for Nickel. Nickel helps you teach your kids to think about money and manage it wisely. It’s part mobile app and part MasterCard debit card. You can set a weekly or monthly allowance, and add a favorable interest rate to encourage your child to save. The allowance is auto-paid from your bank to your child’s Nickel Card, along with the compounding interest (which you also pay). Nickel helps teens and kids ages 8 and up make conscious choices around spending vs. saving—showing them how much interest they’ve earned already, and how much more they could earn if they choose to save instead of spend. Plus, Nickel lets you take the guesswork out of wondering where and how your kids are dropping their dimes by helping you track their spending and saving. But their mission goes beyond what the technology powering the Nickel debit card and app offers. Their goal is to help parents… - Encourage children and teens to make meaningful choices around money - Teach kids the power of compound interest - Help kids save and experience the time-value of money - Spark an important, ongoing dialogue between parents and their children about the value and purpose of money, helping kids develop healthy money habits that can last a lifetime Nickel is for children and their parents. They want to help the next generation learn to manage money by facing real decisions. They believe it’s good to learn from making mistakes young while the stakes are relatively low—with $30 rather than $30,000. Together, they can create a generation that is financially empowered. They created Nickel to give families the tools and resources to help them raise money-smart kids. They’re starting with allowance. The child or teen who thinks about whether to buy something today or save at a compounded-interest rate for tomorrow can develop the habits to grow into a financially savvy adult—one who spends mindfully and invests wisely, one who aligns their money to their values. They imagine a world where youth are empowered to save for college, make smart spending decisions, and maybe even manage an investment portfolio."

Nirma,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nirma,"Chemical, Manufacturing",Nirma is detergents and chemicals maker.,"Nirma is one of the few names - which is instantly recognized as a true Indian brand, which took on mighty multinationals and rewrote the marketing rules to win the heart of princess, i.e. the consumer. Nirma, the proverbial ‘Rags to Riches’ saga of Dr. Karsanbhai Patel, is a classic example of the success of Indian entrepreneurship in the face of stiff competition. Starting as a one-man operation in 1969, today, it has about 18,000+ employee-base and annual turnover is more than 7,000 Crores INR. India is a one of the largest consumer economy, with burgeoning middle class pie. In such a widespread, diverse marketplace, Nirma aptly concentrated all its efforts towards creating and building a strong consumer preference towards its ‘value-for-money’ products. It was way back in ‘60s and ‘70s, where the domestic detergent market had only premium segment, with very few players and was dominated by MNCs. It was 1969, when Karsanbhai Patel started door-to-door selling of his detergent powder, priced at an astonishing Rs. 3 per kg, when the available cheapest brand in the market was Rs. 13 per kg. It was really an innovative, quality product – with indigenous process, packaging and low-profiled marketing, which changed the habit of Indian housewives’ for washing their clothes. In a short span, Nirma created an entirely new market segment in domestic marketplace, which is, eventually the largest consumer pocket and quickly emerged as dominating market player – a position it has never since relinquished. Rewriting the marketing rules, Nirma became a one of the widely discussed success stories between the four-walls of the B-school classrooms across the world. The performance of Nirma during the decade of 1980s has been labelled as ‘Marketing Miracle’ of an era. During this period, the brand surged well ahead its nearest rival – Surf, which was well-established detergent product by Hindustan Lever. It was a severing battering for MNC as it recorded a sharp drop in its market share. Nirma literally captured the market share by offering value-based marketing mix of four P’s, i.e. a perfect match of product, price, place and promotion. Now, the year 2004 sees Nirma’s annual sales touch 800,000 tones, making it one of the largest volume sales with a single brand name in the world. Looking at the FMCG synergies, Nirma stepped into toilet soaps relatively late in 1990 but this did not deter it to achieve a volume of 100,000 per annum. This makes Nirma the largest detergent and the second largest toilet soap brand in India with market share of 38% and 20% respectively. It has been persistent effort of Nirma to make consumer products available to masses at an affordable price. Hence, it takes utmost care to provide finest products at the most affordable prices. To leverage this effort, Nirma has gone for massive backward integration along with expansion and modernization of the manufacturing facilities.  The focal objective behind modernisation plan is of up gradation with resource-savvy technology to optimise capabilities. Nirma’s eleven production facilities, located at different places, are well equipped with state-of-art technologies. To ensure regular supply of major raw materials, Nirma had opted for backward integration strategies. These strategic moves allowed Nirma to manage effective and efficient supply-chain. Nirma has always been practiced ‘value-for-money’ plank. Nirma plans to extend the same philosophy in categories as commodity food products, personal care products and packaged food. Distinct market vision and robust infrastructure allowed Nirma to have cost leadership. Apart from this, lean distribution network, umbrella branding and low profile media promotions allowed it to offer quality products, at affordable prices. Dr. Karsanbhai K. Patel, a marketing legend and philanthropist, is playing role of key strategic decision-maker, whereas his next generation has already skilled management capabilities. Shri Rakesh K Patel – a qualified management graduate, is spearheading the procurement, production and logistic functions, whereas Shri Hiren K Patel – a qualified Chemical engineer and management graduate, heads the marketing and finance functions of the organisation with hands-on approach. Shri Kalpesh Patel, Executive Director, leads recent diversified sector of Health-care, apart from LAB. In recent times, through acquiring manufacturing capabilities in Healthcare, Soda Ash, and Boron production facilities, Nirma has surged new corporate success milestones. In near future, the group is also exploring diversification in Cement sector through a greenfield project.  The man behind the success of Nirma phenomenon – Dr. Karsanbhai Patel is a recipient of various awards and accolades. He has been bestowed with various awards like… Udyog Ratna by Federation of Association of Small-Scale Industries of Gujarat, New Delhi. Outstanding Industrialist of Eighties by Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Ahmedabad (in 1990). Gujarat Businessman Award in 1998 by Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Ahmedabad. Excellence in Corporate Governance Award by Rotary International District 2000. A&M Hall of Fame. Shri Karsanbhai has been awarded an Honorary Doctorate by Florida Atlantic University, Florida, USA in the year 2001 in recognition of his exceptional accomplishments as a philanthropist and businessman. His contributions are also acknowledged by Govt. of India, and he has been endowed with Padmshri in 2010.

Ninkasi Brewing,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ninkasi-brewing,"Brewing, Craft Beer",Ninkasi Brewing Company is dedicated to brewing the highest quality craft beers in support of culture & community.,"In late 2005, Nikos Ridge and Jamie Floyd met at a favorite local bottle shop in Eugene, Ore. Nikos was sampling a beer Jamie had brewed at a local restaurant/brewery and through mutual friends, the two started talking. The conversation landed on the question, ""What would you do if you could open your own brewery?"" With Nikos' background in finance and Jamie's experience in brewing, it seemed like the perfect pairing to start a brewery. The two began brewing about six months later, on June 15, 2006, when Nikos and Jamie spent 17 hours brewing the first batch of Total Domination IPA. The first kegs were produced in a leased space inside of a German restaurant in Springfield, Ore. Once a brewery, the building was equipped with a 15-barrel brewhouse. Here, a new craft brewery was born with one driving purpose—through the creation of the highest quality beers; to improve the lives of its customers, the residents of its communities, its employees, and business partners. Both founders knew they wanted to do things differently—within the beer industry and in the local community. In a time when the industry landscape was home to male-centric brands, Nikos and Jamie strived for a company that represented what beer meant to them—a source of community and the root of human existence. And so, Ninkasi—the Sumerian goddess of fermentation—was selected as the name. Throughout human history, beer not only was a catalyst for written language and organized education, but was also the center of community and culture, one never in operation without the other—a driving force behind the new brewery. In a quest to find property that could cultivate community spirit, the two purchased real estate in Eugene's Whiteaker neighborhood and moved the brewery to its current location in 2007. Since then, Ninkasi has undergone four expansions, to produce more beer for more people. The expansions included a larger production facility, tasting room, office spaces, and local distribution, all while keeping the focus on brewing excellent craft beer. Ninkasi's culture continues to embody ""Believe in the Goddess""—symbolizing the Ninkasi belief in an elevated human experience through the social enjoyment and sharing of beer. The current brewery features a 55-barrel and a 90-barrel brewing system, brewing quality craft beer to be distributed throughout Alaska; Arizona; California; Idaho; Oregon; Washington; Nevada; and Vancouver, British Columbia. The Ninkasi Flagship Series, has grown from its first batch of Total Domination IPA to include Tricerahops Double IPA, Believer Double Red, Oatis Oatmeal Stout, Vanilla Oatis Oatmeal Stout, and Quantum Pale Ale. Today, the Ninkasi family of brands includes its Flagship, Seasonal Release, Special Release, Prismatic Lager, Single Hop, and R&D Series. The ancient Sumerians worshipped the beer they made and praised the Goddess Ninkasi for the miracle of fermentation. As one of the first-known communities, the Sumerians began to forgo hunting and gathering for an agrarian existence, establishing the first foundations of modern civilization. They understood the value of beer in their communities and relied on the brewery as a pillar and hub of social connectivity. Additionally, beer and the fermentation process provided potable water, nourishment, health, and joy. It was the catalyst for written language and education; all valuable contributors to an evolved quality of life and living. Today, Ninkasi Brewing Company is dedicated to brewing the highest quality craft beers in support of culture, community, and the uniqueness of each individual and their passions—while evoking as much enjoyment as possible along the way! They believe in and are committed to sharing experiences that create value for their customers, their partners, and their communities in service to their core purpose: to Perpetuate Better Living. Beer is a staple of civilization. Believe in the Goddess."
