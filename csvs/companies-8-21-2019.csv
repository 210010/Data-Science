Android has a large community of developers writing applications (""apps"") that extend the functionality of the devices. There are currently over 200,000 apps available for Android. Android Market is the online app store run by Google, though apps can also be downloaded from third-party sites. Developers write primarily in the Java language, controlling the device via Google-developed Java libraries. The unveiling of the Android distribution on 5 November 2007 was announced with the founding of the Open Handset Alliance, a consortium of 80 hardware, software, and telecom companies devoted to advancing open standards for mobile devices. Google released most of the Android code under the Apache License, a free software and open source license. The Android open-source software stack consists of Java applications running on a Java-based, object-oriented application framework on top of Java core libraries running on a Dalvik virtual machine featuring JIT compilation. Libraries written in C include the surface manager, OpenCore media framework, SQLite relational database management system, OpenGL ES 2.0 3D graphics API, WebKit layout engine, SGL graphics engine, SSL, and Bionic libc. The Android operating system, including the Linux kernel, consists of roughly 12 million lines of code including 3 million lines of XML, 2.8 million lines of C, 2.1 million lines of Java, and 1.75 million lines of C++."

Abstract builds upon and extends the stable technology of Git to host and manage your work. In 2015, Josh (CEO) and Kevin (CTO) were working together at Habitat when the frequent game of “where’s the latest design” finally drove Kevin to ask, “Why don’t designers have proper version control?” Designers have always been a flexible bunch. Dedicated to bringing great ideas to life and willing to use every possible tool and jump through all kinds of hoops to get their work done. Unfortunately, too much of the design toolset is focused on creating isolated artifacts instead of supporting connected workflows. Designers need more support for half of their job that isn’t drawing shapes, choosing typefaces, or prototyping interactions. The majority of a design job is orchestrating the team, ensuring visual consistency, updating stakeholders, documenting decisions, interpreting feedback, and delivering the work for implementation. When you look at it this way, it becomes clear. We don’t need more visual design tools. We need help managing our work and how design relates to the rest of the organization. So began Abstract. The company's evolving answer to how we believe modern design teams will work. A collaborative, transparent, and effective way to design.   At Abstract, we are actively working to build a diverse and inclusive organization. Here, diversity includes age, economic class, educational background, ethnic variance, familial status, gender, gender expression, gender identity, marital status, national origin, religious affiliation, sex, sexual orientation, transgender status, or veteran status."

When a small satellite has positioning capabilities from a propulsion system, it’s mission lifetime is greatly extended meaning that fewer satellites need to be launched and one satellite can perform multiple tasks. Propulsion allows a small satellite to re-position: keeping it in orbit, changing its position to another orbit, adjusting inclination to align instrumentation and any other positional change that allows a satellite to perform it’s tasks more efficiently and accurately. Accion’s TILE electric ion thrusters are small, affordable, safe, modular, and scalable - opening the benefits of in-space propulsion to the emerging class of small satellites and changing how we interact with our world and other worlds."

The solution allows users to block employees from accessing specific websites, create alarms to capture unauthorized activity, and monitor web and app traffic and usage to safeguard the organization. Users can view activity logs and screenshots from monitored workstations, and analyze reports to manage productivity levels throughout the company. ActivTrak works by installing an invisible agent onto a single or multiple workstations to measure activity. The agent is then able to collect all URLs, title bars, and screenshots, and allows administrators to shut down applications remotely, notifying them of any flagged usage. Screenshots allow administrators to see what the device’s user sees by capturing their entire screen. Screenshots can triggered by alarms, such as keywords within a URL, or scheduled by time intervals. Real-time activity monitoring provides administrators with a live data stream of the current activity from workstations. Data is displayed in rows with information on open websites and applications, how long they were visited or used, and various other data points. User activity reports categorize each user’s activity as productive, unproductive or idle on a color-coded timeline which can be filtered and re-organized by user/group and date/time. Reports also provide information on top websites, applications, or categories for each group, user, or devices. ActivTrak’s website blocking features provide information on low productivity websites, or distracting activities that should be blocked from individual users, groups, or all workstations at once. Alarms can be setup to trigger screenshots, popup messages to device users, email notifications to account administrators, as well as remote application termination on devices.

AdaSky delivers a scalable solution, priced for mass market, that was built to meet the specific and demanding requirements of autonomous vehicles.  AdaSky saw a powerful opportunity in the market. The most basic need for autonomous vehicles is to be able to see and interpret all objects and surroundings, in all conditions. Existing sensors and cameras available today can’t meet this need on their own. To address this, AdaSky engineered a state-of-the-art sensing and perception solution that allows autonomous vehicles to reliably detect, segment, and analyze pedestrians, animals, objects, and road conditions in day or night, regardless of weather condition.  Today’s sensors are limited and often have trouble classifying objects. AdaSky’s advanced thermal sensing solution allows the vehicle to sense and analyze its surroundings by passively collecting FIR signals through detection of thermal energy radiated from objects and their body heat. AdaSky introduces a new modality in which the signals come from a different band of the spectrum, orthogonal to existing imaging solutions. AdaSky’s image processing and computer vision algorithms process the signals collected by the camera to provide accurate object detection and scene analysis, giving the vehicle a new layer of information and the ability to precisely detect pedestrians 200 meters away or more, allowing more distance in which to react to driving decisions. FIR technology has been used for decades in other vertical industries, making it a mature and proven concept with demonstrated scalable technology priced for mass market. AdaSky leveraged this mature technology and adapted it specifically for autonomous vehicles to create a solution that complements other sensing technology, such as Lidar, Radar, and standard cameras, while providing a crucial additional layer of vision and brains. In fact, AdaSky’s solution is performing at its best in use cases when other sensors in the car have no perception and are unable to see. When combined with other sensors, AdaSky’s solution gives autonomous vehicles perception of their surroundings in any condition.  AdaSky is a quick-moving start-up, comprised of an experienced team that combines image-processing and thermal sensing industry vets from the Israeli high-tech market, automotive experts, and machine-learning and computer-vision specialists.  AdaSky was founded with the core vision of advancing the autonomous vehicle market with a bold perception solution that increases the safety and performance of the self-driving car. The team took the very mature thermal sensing technology that its founders had worked with for decades and specifically adapted it for the needs of the automotive market."

While many companies are working to develop antibody therapies based on mouse- or human-derived antibody technologies, Apexigen is pioneering a movement into therapeutics based on rabbit-derived humanized monoclonal antibodies as a means of providing therapeutic benefits that have not been achieved through the use of other technologies. Several blockbuster antibody drugs have been developed with existing mouse and human antibody technologies and display libraries. However, the development of the next generation of antibody-based drugs will require capabilities that exceed those of current technologies in order to bind rare or intractable antigen epitopes and to exert novel effects on disease processes. The key to these next generation therapeutics lies in harnessing the inherent advantages of rabbit antibodies, which have been used successfully in research settings for decades. These advantages are the result of rabbit’s ability to generate a much greater diversity of unique high quality antibodies - with high affinity, high specificity and which bind unique antigen epitopes. These attributes enable the discovery of antibodies that are capable of targeting previously unreachable disease mechanisms."

Yet there are a lot of moving parts in this new cloud-native world – more discrete pieces of software like microservices and functions. There are many phases of the development and delivery flow – code review, build, unit test, containerize, integration test, binary artifacts, container cluster managers, manual and scripted release steps, health checks, and performance monitoring. We believe that developers should have tools to take care of the individual stages of that flow, and very importantly, a way to integrate, streamline, and automate the overall flow from code to ship. We started Atomist to build that platform for developers. We have deep roots in open source and serving developers at SpringSource, Pivotal/VMware, GitHub and Oracle. Our core technologies are rooted in deeply understanding the code, people, and flow.
