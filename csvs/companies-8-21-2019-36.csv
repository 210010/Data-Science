Keeros,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/keeros,"Food and Beverage, Food Delivery, Snack Food","Keeros Founders, Sachin Sahni and Simran Sahni are seasoned professionals in the health and wellness industry with an experience of over 19 years. Having successfully served over 50,000 clients they noticed that when it came to satisfying their mid-meal hunger pangs, people often went for snacks that were deep-fried, loaded with artificial flavours and extremely unhealthy. This got them thinking about whether they could come up with healthier alternatives that offered wholesome nutrition. The challenge was to come up with something that would be appealing to the taste buds and at the same time was also easy on the pocket. Another goal that spurred them on was the determination to create healthy-snacking options for diabetics, who had limited choices. The duo got down to work and sought inspiration from traditional Indian foods and global health food trends. They experimented with different blends, learning something from each mistake and carrying on with the experience gained. Their perseverance finally paid off with the creation of a perfect blend of great taste and nutritional benefits -Keeros Roasted Supersnacks that are Healthy for All, Safe for Diabetics."

However, the history of KEMET actually began a long time ago. Kemet Laboratories was established by Union Carbide Corporation in 1919 to purchase the Cooper Research Company of Cleveland, Ohio, which had invented a promising high-temperature alloy. The name ""KEMET"" is a blend of the words ""chemical"" and ""metallurgy."" KEMET's first product used this high-temperature alloy for grid wires in vacuum tubes. In 1930, the product line was expanded to include barium-aluminum alloy getters, an essential element in vacuum tubes. KEMET's development of automatic machinery allowed production of high-quality getters in the huge quantities needed to match the rapid expansion of vacuum tube usage. In fact, it is estimated that over 80% of the vacuum tubes used by the Allies during World War II contained KEMET getters. The business continued to grow and prosper until the early 1950s when Bell Telephone Laboratories invented the transistor. As the transistor began to displace vacuum tubes in electronics, the getter business stagnated. Fortunately for KEMET, Bell Laboratories had also invented the solid tantalum capacitor, which complemented the use of low-voltage transistors (semi-conductors) in electrical circuits. Since Union Carbide had experience in the fields of high-temperature metals and alloys, the solid tantalum capacitor was chosen as KEMET's ""new product"" to complement the getter product line and to provide the vehicle for future growth."

Kendall Family Foundation,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kendall-familyfoundation,Association,"The Henry P. Kendall Foundation is a legacy of its namesake, an early twentieth-century New England entrepreneur and industrialist (1878-1959) from Walpole, Massachusetts. Kendall's wide-ranging, venturesome business instincts led to acquisitions of factories and other companies through the company that bore his name, The Kendall Company. Henry W. and John P. Kendall established the Norfolk Charitable Trust in 1957. Following the death of their father in 1959, they changed the name to the Henry P. Kendall Foundation in his honor. The Kendall Foundation began an emphasis on environmental concerns in the early 1970s by supporting land, water and wildlife conservation. A decade later, as the threat of nuclear war persisted into the 1980s, the Foundation focused on nuclear non-proliferation and arms-control activities. One of its grantees, International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1999 the Foundation initiated a climate change program when it created a new organization, Clean Air-Cool Planet, to focus specifically on steps to address accelerating greenhouse gas emissions. The Foundation began to expand its climate change program to support a wide-range of organizations, predominantly those with directed efforts in the Northeast region, and in 2006, re-oriented its focus to strategies for reducing greenhouse gases and developing early steps for adapting to the impacts of global warming on the landscape. In 2009, the Trustees decided to take time to reflect on the Foundation’s history and determine a new direction for its grantmaking and associated activities. After a period of reflection, planning, and outreach, the Foundation began launching its new program in 2011 focused on creating a sustainable and resilient food system in New England."

Unsatisfied with the limits of iron-based weight training, he and his brother, Randy, found a safer—and more efficient—alternative that uses compressed air, or pneumatics, to provide a smoother, controlled resistance. In 1978, the brothers introduced to the world the first air-powered variable resistance exercise machines for building strength and power.     More than 80% of the top professional sports teams in the world now train on Keiser machines, including all 32 Major League Baseball teams, several Super Bowl winners, the football (soccer) champions of nine countries, Olympic athletes and more. They’re joined by everyone from NASA to Navy Seals, medical experts to rehab specialists and from major gyms, like LA Fitness, to neighborhood studios.    And with over a quarter-million Keiser indoor bikes sold worldwide, trainers and fitness facility managers agree that our award-winning M Series, featuring our magnetic resistance system, offers the ultimate indoor cycling experience."

KE Fibertec,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ke-fibertec,Machinery Manufacturing,"KE Fibertec AS develops, manufactures, and markets ""Good indoor climate"" or air distribution systems based on fibre technology. The principle is to create draught-free and uniform distribution of the ventilation air through our tailored textile ducts. Today, air distribution systems are used in almost all applications - from industry to sports centres, office facilities, laboratories, food industry, and many other applications that require a good indoor climate. The foundation of KE Fibertec goes back to 1963 when Keld Ellentoft (KE) began manufacturing filterbags for industry. In 1996 KE Fibertec was founded in a management buyout by two leading staff members, Henning S. Jensen and Carsten Jespersen. In March 2007 Henning S. Jensen sold his shares to Jysk-Fynsk Kapital AS, and Sales Director Carsten Jespersen was appointed new managing director. KE Fibertec is owned by Jysk-Fynsk Kapital (70%), L. E. Kristiansen Erhvervsinvest ApS (10%), and KE Pulje ApS (20%). KE Pulje is owned by the day-to-day management group of KE Fibertec (Managing Director Carsten Jespersen, Produktion Director Johnny Kusk Møller, and Financial Manager Svend Anker Fogh). Behind Jysk-Fynsk Kapital are 5 well-known Danish family foundations: AHF Holding (Faber Gardiner), Genua A/S (Primo Group), Hoffmann Capital A/S (Arovit Petfood), L. E. Kristiansen Erhvervsinvest ApS (Tvilum Scanbirk), and Vald. Birn Holding A/S (Valdemar Birn Group). Today, the KE Fibertec Group is composed of five sales subsidiaries in the UK, Germany, Turkey and the USA as well as Euro Air A/S. Further, the group holds two production companies, KE Fibertec Væveri (weaving mill) and Euro Air CZ. With the acquisition of our competitor, Euro Air A/S and Euro Air CZ, the KE Group has consolidated its position as the world's largest manufacturer of textile ducting. Today, the company employs approx. 120 people, with around 50% employed at our foreign subsidiaries. In recent years KE Fibertec has invested a lot of efforts in energy-efficient and sustainable solutions. As early as in 2012 we managed to get CradleVent® certified as the first Cradle to Cradle ventilation duct in the world. As part of our sustainable ventilation programme KE Fibertec offers a so-called EPD (Environmental Product Declaration) of all primary products combined with life cycle analyses. In 2014 we introduced InTex® which is an intelligent system to monitor the performance of textile ducts and when it is time for washing the customer will be alerted by email. This will provide for a healthy indoor climate and energy savings which is good for both environment and the operating economy of the system. In 2016 KE Fibertec upgraded the total material programme so that we offer 3 unique material lines (GreenWeave, MultiWeave and ZeroWeave). As the only manufacturer in the world, KE Fibertec produces all textiles in our own weaving mill, tailored for air distribution and with full traceability."

"Kendall, Koenig & Oelsner (KKO)",https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kendall-koenig-oelsner-kko,Legal,"Kendall, Koenig & Oelsner is a corporate transactional and business law boutique that represents businesses, financial institutions, private equity funds, investors and individuals in a broad range of sophisticated transactional matters. KKO is a trusted advisor to their clients, including as outside general counsel for many businesses. Their attorneys have worked with clients ranging from start-ups to Fortune 100 companies and have assisted clients with deals ranging in values from the thousands to the billions. Every client and project is different, so they work cooperatively with their clients to understand and meet their needs. Rather than herding clients toward ill-suited solutions and models created for others, KKO helps clients find opportunities and solve problems in a manner specially tailored for their particular circumstances. KKO works with clients on transactional legal matters, including mergers and acquisitions, private equity and venture capital investments, securities, credit finance, entity formation and commercial contracts. KKO also assists clients with general legal matters arising in the operation of their business, including documenting employment relationships, preparing incentive plans and maintaining company records. KKO does not employ attorneys with little or no experience. Their clients deserve experienced attorneys capable of providing practical advice and being trusted advisors and creative problem-solvers. KKO’s model ensures that their clients do not have to foot the bill for first and second year attorneys to obtain the practical skills they did not learn in law school. They hate over-lawyering as much as their clients do. They think it is about time that impractical attorneys without business sense stop being rewarded for being inefficient and unreasonable. They are committed to providing the highest level of attentive service and expertise to their clients. If a client or a project is small in size, it does not mean that sophisticated, expert legal service is unwarranted. KKO’s business model allows their experienced and practical attorneys to deliver value through efficiency and creativity. Since they do not hire attorneys without practical deal experience, they will never assign lawyers fresh out of law school to transactions and attempt to pass it off to clients as a bargain. KKO was designed to provide practical, personalized legal service while substantially reducing the administrative and infrastructure costs that are typically absorbed by clients. Advances in technology have made it possible for a small, dynamic firm like KKO to efficiently serve their clients in Colorado and around the globe without incurring the s"
