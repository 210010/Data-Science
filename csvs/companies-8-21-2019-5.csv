Though its products are currently targeting the mobile app market, Everspin with its highly versatile technology is expected to launch its service for Web/PC, server and IoT in the near future.  ■ Solution Features: -App/OS/Memory forgery prevention. -Real-time hacking detection. -Instant security update to multiple types of devices without any user-side program update. ■ Credibility -First ever to pass all the security tests by National Security Research Institute in Korea(100% blocking rate for 3,000++ hacking attempts). -Within 1year sales, secured 23cutomers including 3/5 of major banks in Korea. -SBI Holdings to gradually implement Everspin solution to all of its 200++ subsidiaries around the world."

Ecovative Design,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ecovative-designs,"Advanced Materials, Innovation Management, Sustainability","Eben Bayer and Gavin McIntyre were fascinated by mushrooms growing on wood chips, and observing how the fungal mycelium strongly bonded the wood chips together.

In a class at Rensselaer, called Inventor's Studio, they applied this new process for binding together insulating particles, creating Greensulateâ„¢. Rather than just decreasing the environmental impact of conventional polystyrene foams, this invention creates a whole new paradigm where composite materials are literally grown, harnessing the incredible efficiency of nature. Shortly after founding the company, they won small grants from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and the National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance (NCIIA). This funding was used to create initial samples of the material. This proof of concept enabled the company to win bigger grants from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to further develop the products. Since then, Ecovative has won many more awards and grants that have enabled the company to continue to grow and accelerate toward production of these revolutionary eco-friendly materials. At Ecovative, we are passionate about sustainability. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re working with nature to replace unsustainable plastics and foams with natural composites.

Monoclonal antibodies have transformed the treatment of human diseases, including inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, cancer, severe infections and many rare conditions over the course of the past two decades. Bi-specific antibodies are engineered from two different monoclonal antibodies and combine their key features into one molecule. As a novel drug class, bi-specifics provide additional options for the treatment of many life-threatening diseases such as cancer. However, even minor modifications to any pharmaceutically active biologic such as an antibody can significantly change the properties critical to its development, such as its binding properties, the pharmacokinetics, its stability, solubility and the ability to produce it in sufficient quantities at reasonable costs. This challenge has prevented a majority of bi-specific antibodies of potential interest to scientists and clinicians from advancing into clinical development because their drug-like features were compromised. Thus, the need for a new generation of bi-specific antibody therapeutics in the pharmaceutical industry remains high."

We aim to democratize education among the learning community by giving FREE access to the platform.  WHAT IS THE REVENUE MODEL OF EASYCLASS? Our business model is very different from other LMS providers as our platform is completely free of charge. It boils down to the idea that a platform with millions of students and instructors is very valuable, because it could be leveraged for distributing content such as educational applications, videos and digital books. There are many possibilities for the future, but right now our focus is on building the platform and providing a great experience to our users. WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES EASYCLASS A SECURE AND PRIVATE ENVIRONMENT? -Easyclass platform targets only educators and students.  -Digital classes on Easyclass.com are created and managed by the teachers/professors. -Teachers/Professors have full administrative rights on student participation in their class. o  Students need an access code to join the class. If a student shares the code outside the class, the teacher can change it, without affecting students who are already enrolled in the class. o  Teachers can delete posts and remove class members.  o  Teachers may choose to receive automatic notification of student postings into the class before they are published on class walls. o  Anonymous posting is not possible. -The content created within the digital classes can be viewed by the class members only as they are effectively closed groups.  -Private conversation between students is not possible. Students may only communicate to the whole class or the teacher, which reduces opportunities for cyber-bullying. -If a school upgrades (free feature to be launched soon) to the institutional features, the school admin can audit all teacher and student activity.  -Parental access to their children’s posts/grades and to the teacher is an optional feature, which is also to be launched soon.  -Easyclass does not have any advertisements. -Easyclass is hosted on Amazon Cloud / Ireland. BENEFITS TO TEACHERS/PROFESSORS -It’s easy to learn and use: The interface works like Facebook but is even easier to use. Easyclass.com is not overloaded with complicated features and presents a user-friendly interface.  -Time saving. Imagine you have to grade 143 tests comprising 50 multiple choice questions each! Easyclass will do it for you.  -No more photocopying, carrying and grading stacks of paper and writing comments out. All of this can be done online for your assignments, tests and quizzes whenever wherever you are.  -Enhanced learning: In today's classrooms, there is often limited time to cover topics fully. When Easyclass is used as a learning platform, additional resources can be used to enhance learning. -Great platform for Blended Learning initiatives: If you are looking to incorporate more digital content in your curriculum and looking for a robust platform that is affordable (like, free!) then Easyclass may be a perfect fit. -Continuous professional development: Easyclass Groups provide a way for teachers to connect with like-minded educators to exchange ideas, get advice and share resources. -Ability to stay connected with students: From snow days, swine flu, extended absences or just attending to a conference, teachers are able to be connected with their students.  -Safe environment: With no advertisements and a process which gives full control to the teachers/professors for managing the classes, Easyclass addresses the fundamental concerns of privacy and safety. The content created within the digital classes can be viewed by the class members only!  -Digital citizenship: Easyclass provides teachers the opportunity to teach responsible interaction via digital means, reinforcing good digital citizenship among students. -Support: The support Easyclass team offers is amazing! We get back to any queries within 24 hours.   BENEFITS TO STUDENTS -The platform is so easy that lower elementary students can be taught to use it. -Online resources and materials stored in digital classes are at the fingertips of the users. -Easyclass allows students not only to learn from their teachers but also from other students.  -Online discussions promote collaborative exploration and critical thinking and hence foster deeper understanding among students towards the subject matter.  -When students interact with their teachers outside the class, their attitude towards the teachers changes dramatically in a positive way.  -Students build their skills of becoming independent and responsible by logging in to view and submit assignments and hence monitor progress. This is something they would normally experience in college and in their career. -Students can submit quizzes and see their results immediately (except for short answer questions). -Easyclass promotes student confidence. Some of the teachers on Easyclass say that one student who isn’t comfortable speaking up in the classroom is opening up online. -Using Easyclass gives students the feeling of using a social-networking site without having to mix their personal lives with their school lives. -Students enjoy the interaction Easyclass brings in the classroom on this 24/7 online environment."

The Federation of West African Chambers of Commerce promoted and initiated a project to create a private, regional banking institution in West Africa. In 1984, Ecopromotions S.A. was incorporated. Its founding shareholders raised seed capital for feasibility studies and the promotional activities leading to the creation of ETI. In October 1985, ETI was incorporated with authorised capital of US$100 million. The initial paid up capital of US$32 million was raised from over 1,500 individuals and institutions from West African countries. The largest shareholder was the ECOWAS Fund for Cooperation, Compensation and Development (ECOWAS Fund), the development finance arm of ECOWAS. Ecobank signed a Headquarters’ Agreement with the Government of Togo in 1985, which granted it the status of an international organisation. This status came with the rights and privileges necessary for ETI to operate as a regional institution, including the status of a non-resident financial institution. ETI commenced operations with its first subsidiary in Togo in March 1988."

Elephantech inc.,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/agic-inc,"Electronics, Manufacturing","Elephantech is a startup company that aims to drastically innovate the technology for manufacturing electronic circuits, with the vision of achieving faster manufacturing at lower cost by leveraging printing technology. Electronic circuits are literally part of social infrastructures and are embedded everywhere in the world that we live in today. While the number and types of electronic devices being used by humans have been increasing dramatically, driven by advances in semiconductor and telecommunication technology, the technology for manufacturing electronic circuits has not seen any major innovation over the past 50 years. Conventional electronic circuits are manufactured through a process called photolithography, which involves applying metal all over the surface of a substrate and melting the metal off any unrequired areas. However, photolithography has the disadvantage of wasting large amounts of the materials used and driving up the production cost, in addition to being harmful to the environment. Elephantech’s suggested manufacturing method, which is a totally opposite approach to photolithography, involves printing metal only onto the required areas using inkjet printing and enlarging the printed metal by applying plating technology. This approach has enabled Elephantech to manufacture PWBs at significantly lower cost as the amounts of materials required and the number of processes have been reduced. In addition, as this is an on-demand manufacturing solution that does not require any initial cost, it is cost-effective especially for producing prototypes in small quantities, the cost of which can be reduced by at least 80%. We currently possess the best technology in the world for manufacturing PWBs using inkjet printers, the business of which is slated to expand rapidly going forward. Elephantech is committed to accelerating global manufacturing activities by leveraging such technology."
