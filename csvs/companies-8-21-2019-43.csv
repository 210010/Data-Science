Rewards.com,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rewards-com,Retail,"INVESTOR INFO HERE: http://DallasStartups.com/portfolio/rewards-com-startup-with-a-head-start/ What is Rewards.com? Rewards.com is a brand agnostic loyalty point’s clearinghouse that consolidates all your loyalty programs into one easy efficient marketplace where customers shop, earn points, redeem points, and take advantage of discounts. Rewards.com was spun off from DBG Loyalty in Dallas, a leading innovator in loyalty and rewards marketing programs for Bank of America, Sony, Caesars Entertainment, General Motors, Nissan, Toronto Dominion Bank, American Airlines, Marriott and more, equating to over 30 million customers. The startup includes the executive leadership and mature platform from the parent company. The platform is solid and proven, with 10k registered users, over 7000 coalition merchants including Jet.com, Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Uber, Quicken Loans, Smithsonian, Hyatt, Susan G. Komen, and many more. Revenue is generated each time someone makes a purchase on a merchant site. The merchants pay a commission of 3% to 75% of the total sale to Rewards.com. They also provide special offers, coupons, and discounts for driving high sales volumes to their online storefronts. Rewards.com keeps 40% – 60% of the commission and passes a portion on to the customer. Rewards.com has a significant advantage because it is brand agnostic means it has partnerships and partnership potential with thousands of companies. Being an agnostic loyalty point’s coalition that consolidates loyalty programs into one easy efficient shopping site, is a market first. URL: www.Rewards.com  Industry: Loyalty Points Clearinghouse  What: Consolidates all your loyalty programs into one easy and efficient marketplace  Beta Launch: June 2017  Current Situation: Platform is built and already has 10k active users; over 7000 coalition merchants including Jet.com, Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Uber, Quicken Loans, Smithsonian, CBS, Hyatt, Susan G. Komen, and more.  PROBLEM IN THE MARKET Customers have an average of 29 loyalty programs per. Redeeming is a nightmare.  Customers are tired of too many programs and not enough reward. SOLUTION Rewards.com is a brand agnostic loyalty points clearing house that consolidates all your loyalty programs into one easy and efficient clearinghouse marketplace where customers shop, earn points, redeem points, and take advantage of discounts. The company was spun out of a 15-year old loyalty database marketing company (DBG Loyalty located in Dallas) who is a leading innovator in loyalty and rewards marketing programs for Bank of America, Sony, Caesars Entertainment, General Motors, Nissan, Toronto Dominion Bank, American Airlines, Marriott and more, equating to over 30 million customers. WHY NOW? Coalitions are highly successful in other countries and have been for many years.  The timing is right for the United States and Rewards.com is the right opportunity because it is credit card, bank, and retailer neutral, giving it an edge in forming partnerships with coalition members. MARKET SIZE $291 billion ecommerce industry in the US. (*IBIS World) The Rewards.com Marketplace literally allows a shopper to purchase anything. Electronics, Department Stores, Travel, Office Supplies, Gift Cards, and Home goods are among the most popular categories. Shoppers of all ages, races, and incomes have increasingly more expectations of lower prices combined with a higher value. Rewards Marketplace is the solution for both, giving the Rewards Marketplace an edge over singular businesses that depend on either a low-cost or high-value strategies. The target market includes shoppers who are making purchases online or through a mobile device or tablet, as well as at in-store. Our goal is to identify profitable customers and their purchase patterns, and reward desirable behavior accordingly. Truly giving insight and understanding to behavior loyalty. BUSINESS MODEL Breakage and float are two strategic parts of gift cards and point redemptions. The value of unredeemed points and unused gift cards has significant value. Rewards.com sells points as part of their service offering to marketplace members, and breakage has accrued value. Ultimately Rewards wins if a shopper redeems their point because essentially they just made another purchase that is subject to retailer commission. In addition, revenue is derived from: •	Merchants pay a commission of 3% to 75% of the total sale to Rewards.com for customers and provide special offers, coupons, and discounts for driving high sales volumes to their online storefronts. •	Rewards.com keeps 40% – 60% of the commission and passes a portion on to the customer. •	Revenue from “Featured Advertising” and product placement •	Revenue from Email promotions to the Rewards.com customer database TECHNOLOGY •	Scalable software architecture with the flexibility to dynamically target customers and feature partners. •	Easy for customers to use and gain valuable shopping experiences with the incentives for the masses. COMPETITION Ebates.com is a cash-back model. Although hugely successful they struggle with shopper engagement and retaining shoppers year-after-year. Churn is high and engagement is low. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE Rewards.com has a significant advantage because it is brand agnostic means it has partnerships and partnership potential with thousands of companies. Being an agnostic loyalty point’s coalition that consolidates loyalty programs into one easy efficient shopping site is a market first. •	Mature and proven technology platform is live •	Seasoned executives who innovated loyalty programs for American Airlines, American Express, IHG and more. •	Estimated customer base 30mm •	Signed strategic partnerships MARKETING PLAN With a $3m raise, $2m will be spent reaching two goals. •	The first goal is to reach 105k active subscribers to reach $7m in revenue. •	The second goal is to reach 180k active subscribers to reach critical mass.

Dilated cardiomyopathy is a condition affecting over 3 million patients in the US and growing steadily. Many patients develop DCM due to ischemic heart disease. Recently subpopulations have been identified that develop DCM due to mutations in specific genes that have been shown to result in the development of DCM. One of these specific genes is the BAG3 gene. The prevalence of disease‑causing BAG3 haploinsufficiency is estimated at approximately 35,000 individuals in the United States, representing an orphan disease by FDA guidelines. It is estimated a similar number of DCM patients with BAG3 mutations exist in Europe. These patients are typically younger and progress to end stage heart failure sooner than patients with ischemic heart disease. Currently DCM patients with a BAG3 mutation are treated with standard of care for heart failure. Despite improvements in pharmacotherapy and care, the five‑year survival of a patient with DCM is only 50%. Development of a BAG3 gene replacement therapy for patients with DCM that carry BAG3 mutations could potentially prevent progression of disease in this otherwise healthy population of young adults."

Research conducted by the inventor of Repairogen's technology revealed that a cell’s natural mechanism for DNA-repair is greatly enhanced by interfering with the activity of a single protein. By blocking the activity of this specific protein, Repairogen’s proprietary technology directly targets the root cause of skin aging: DNA damage. "

How? For starters, by creating the first solution for owners that puts small landlords...well, first. Next, we ditched paper and the web-portal for tenants and designing something that a tenant would love to use as much as the property owner.  We live in a mobile world, and being a tenant shouldn't change that; so, tenants can do everything from the palms of their hands.   And we didn't stop at the tenant apps; owners can manage just as well from an office and as on the run–that's our anywhere (and anytime) promise. And importantly, we did all of this in a way that allows us to add value while keeping pricing to a simple subscription model, removing barriers to entry, and making sure owners end up with more money in their pockets at the end of the year instead of less.

THE BIG IDEA THAT MATTERS NOW Imagine the value of a new mobile network where you can discover and connect into myriads of trusted, community-driven B2C message boards personalized by your interests and location. That's Relevnt. For users, Relevnt manages your daily local life, keeping you informed on what’s going on around you, connecting you into like-minded communities, and showcasing how to spend your time and money. It's the best way to connect into local conversations, content, and culture wherever you are and wherever you go.  For local business, it’s less about branding and more about driving transactions. As such, Relevnt picks up where other location-based apps such as Nextdoor, Yelp, Groupon, Craigslist, and Meetup left off. By aggregating local creators and product/service providers onto a new decentralized network of location-based B2C message boards, Relevnt offers them a more economical and authentic way to promote and communicate directly in real time with local consumers. In short, Relevnt becomes the new driving force of the local business economy for today’s millennial audiences. RELEVNT STATUS Wrapped in a social media-styled user experience initially aimed at millennial audiences, we’re launching hyper-local B2C message boards on college-specific campuses and then expanding into complementary local vertical applications. We believe that the business model that drives these new local messaging networks will revolutionize how local consumers and businesses communicate with each other all over the world. Let’s face it, the industry standard of 1-2% CTRs for local advertisers totally sucks, which suggests a 98-99% failure rate, and we’re going to fix that.

RewardMe,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rewardme,"Advertising, CRM, Loyalty Programs, Mobile","RewardMe is the world’s first Real-time Intelligent CRM Platform for Local Commerce, created to solve the most pressing problem facing local businesses today:  the anonymous customer. Over time, technology, big-brand growth and quick staff turnover have contributed to an institutional amnesia of the individual customer: who they are, and how they buy. Online retailers like Amazon generate 60% of revenue by acting instantly on knowledge of visiting customers, while local commerce remains largely ignorant of the next customer to walk through their front door. RewardMe brings the CRM capabilities of eCommerce giants to offline stores, giving merchants detailed knowledge of their unique customers, and the ability to act upon this information in real time. RewardMe delivers this ""inevitable future"" of local commerce by connecting a network of devices: the Point-of-Sale System (POS), in-store interactive tablets, and consumer phones. The RewardMe Platform enables commerce solutions like card-less loyalty, detailed customer analytics, eReceipts, surveys and feedback programs, intelligent mobile marketing, as well as vertical-specific applications that support the offline space. The goal of this disruptive technology is to resuscitate the art of high-touch sales – where it has been lost and where it was never previously economical – boosting revenues along the way. In the process, RewardMe is creating the world’s largest database of sales-specific Personal Identifying Information (PII).

Regulus Cyber,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/regulus-cyber,"Autonomous Vehicles, Computer, Drones, Enterprise, Security, Software","Regulus is the first company looking at sensor security as its primary focus. Sensors in cars, drones and robots are the heart of the autonomous revolution. But, unlike connected car security, little attention has been given to securing these sensors – from GPS to LiDAR to Radar and cameras. ​Sensors are prone to different physical hacks that can be achieved without hacking into the ECUs of a car via the Internet. This could pose serious dangers to any platform dependent on sensors. ​Regulus also provides security and redundancy to the mission and safety critical C2 communication that allows command, control and data transfer between the vehicle and a control center, or other vehicles in the network. C2 today suffers from security weaknesses and lack of redundancy and robustness. ​This is where we come in – developing Pyramid - the first ""Security Center"" for vehicles and other platforms, defending both communication and sensors such as GPS, LiDAR and Radar from smart physical hacks. ​The Regulus Pyramid Security Center Suite ​Pyramid SVS - Sensor Validation System for Sensor Dependent Vehicles ​Defending the GPS / GNSS, LiDAR and Radar from smart physical hacks. This is a combination of an external, independent sensor to identify, alert and mitigate attacks against sensors, both locally and in a fleet / network environment, with a monitoring and management system for full security. Coming 2019. ​Pyramid SP - GNSS Spoofing Protection ​Pyramid GPS SP is the first available component of the SVS - the first commercial grade, multi-constellation navigation solution with robust, built-in GNSS spoofing and jamming defense.  GNSS spoofing attacks are becoming easy to create by anyone with a $300 kit and open source software ​Pyramid CSM & CSM CL - Communication & Security Manager for Vehicles ​Enabling unparalleled secure communication for any vehicle with C2 and mission channels (LTE, point-to-point, satellite). Adds robust external AES encryption in GCM mode with authenticity, communication links redundancy with automatic switching, and RF mapping capabilities.  The CSM CL adds an onboard cellular data link with global SIM cards, allowing immediate cellular connectivity and link redundancy with another point to point data link, and a relay service cloud support.
