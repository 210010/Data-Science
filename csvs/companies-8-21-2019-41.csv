Following a “hub-and-spoke” model we have built a central holding company from which we will incubate several different yet complimentary subsidiaries each with its own market application and commensurate product and technology focus. The business structure is very much consistent with the original premise of Paratus Diagnostics that a common denominator missing from all diagnostic and biological detection solutions is the lack of a simplified sample preparation solution. The genesis of our company was built on the notion that a universal module could be constructed that would address this gap in the in-vitro diagnostics landscape and enable many different diagnostic applications and assay formats without the need for trained laboratory technicians and equipment while maintaining a common core design and manufacturing structure. We have trademarked this common core as the Paratus SDS®, a low-cost consumable cartridge which can be tailored for a variety of assay formats and biological samples to meet numerous diagnostic needs. While the impetus for the Paratus SDS® was the need for a simplified and highly automated sample preparation solution, each cartridge is capable of performing a completely self-contained assay, enabling a true sample-to-answer solution."

Paytailor is far more than just Mobile payment solution, enabling users to access multiple services beyond the scope of the ​mobile payment as such. Paytailor solves two very fundamental problems, millions of businesses globally face. These are accessibility and costs, fuelled by cash payments and card terminals. Both expensive, and limiting the ability to choose how and where to accept payments. Most mobile payment solutions require integrations, card terminals or additional hardware. So, those ways of payment don’t really solve any problems or create new values. For merchants, it’s an investment in hardware that does not yield any new payment scenarios. They are still tied down to the same location, the same customers and the same card payment. Only the mechanics (swipe vs. chip vs. tap) vary from solution to solution.  Paytailor replaced physical payment with virtual, which means everything is entirely on the cloud. This enables to accept payments in multiple ways, allowing businesses to choose the most beneficial for their business. We can onboard merchants in 8 minutes virtually and they can start accepting payments with an existing device and bank account, no integrations needed. Paytailor also has a public API which allows simple and fast integration with PoS systems, in-app e-commerce and IoT payments (which means we can make devices, doors, gates, machines etc to accept mobile payments).  Paytailor gives people the freedom of paying remotely and by any means of payment they prefer. Paytailor acts as a payment aggregator, which means different payment methods in addition to credit or debit card (mobile carrier billing, PSD2 open banking- direct debiting, top-up solutions, even cryptocurrencies etc). That allows customers to choose the method most suitable for them and on the business side, save costs from payment processing fees. For Paytailor it means easy scaling, also to underbanked areas."

Parabola,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/parabola,"Financial Services, FinTech, Mobile Apps, SaaS","Parabola is a mobile app specifically designed to help improve retirement plan participation and outcomes; educate, encourage, reward savings habits; and provide financial advisors with the tools and up-to-date information necessary to proactively support the success of the individual and determined goals within the advisors prescribed financial plan. We all know that the defined contribution plan system at present has massive room for improvement. By and large, employees simply don't save enough to retire well. Most participants have a ""set it and forget it” mentality during an enrollment meeting and that’s the last time they are engaged. Parabola aims to disrupt the current retirement system by optimizing it to reach its full potential and finally be an adequate replacement for the obsolete defined benefit plan liability. In other words – pushing the probability light years ahead toward meeting the saver’s needs. The Parabola mobile app helps the end user reduce financial stress by linking their accounts and automatically tracking progress toward nearly 50 common and pre-defined financial goals. The user is notified when they reach a goal and awarded a badge, similar to what you might see with Fitbit or other fitness-related concepts.  Because the user has linked their various accounts (the average adult has 16 different accounts from credit cards to checking/savings to car and mortgage loans), they can more consistently and easily make deposits, enhancements, asset allocations, evaluations, and more. Their advisor (who provides the mobile app) receives a more complete financial picture much more quickly than the typical data collection method and can give better financial advice as a result. Rather than focusing on data collection, the advisor can best utilize time helping the client. This information is always up to date and readily available. Our primary goal is to drive users to increase contributions to their company retirement plans and personal investments. The natural effect is better outcomes toward achieving goals while AUM increases which helps advisors build AUM (and their compensation) more quickly."
