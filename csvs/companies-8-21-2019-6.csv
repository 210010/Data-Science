Microsoft did it with Word, which revolutionized documents; it did it with Excel for spreadsheets; and it did it again with Powerpoint for presentations.

Since Microsoft, the world has moved online, has moved to mobile, and the things that are now integral to business and culture have shifted. Today, if you created a pie chart of the utilities that are essential to business and society it would consist of mobile apps, videos, ads, articles, and online presentations. The problem for these modern utilities is they suffer from the same problems that documents, spreadsheets, and presentations did at the dawn of Microsoft’s empire. They are time consuming, they are costly to create, and there exists to no unified, integrated way of managing and storing them.  What Famous intends to do is revolutionize creation, storage, and management of these new Internet utilities. Together with our platform, called Famous Studio, we will offer powerful creation tools for Instant Apps, Instant Ads, Instant Videos, Instant Articles, and Instant Presentations that reduce creation time from months to minutes.

So they decided to invent their own. Their vision is that protein science will transform their understanding of how the biological world operates in real time. They believe that this transformation will be every bit as revolutionary as the way that advances in DNA sequencing have transformed their understanding of how the biological world operates over decades, lifetimes and generations. And they believe that Fluidic Analytics can help make this vision a reality by developing products that enable easier, faster, more convenient and more accurate protein characterisation, whether in the lab, at the bedside or in everyday life. They've combined cutting edge technology, a fantastic team and best practice in management and communication to go from their founding to a customer ready prototype in 2 years. And they’re only just beginning. This instrument is just the first step towards a platform technology that will serve as the interface between the biological and digital world – as they continue to expand what is possible for their customers. Their desire for accessibility and openness is present in their company’s culture of communication and integrity, in the usability of their products, in their open exchange of ideas with their collaborators and in their commitment to their users complete ownership of their own data.

There are more than 450Mn smartphone users in India (growing at 15% cagr) who have mobile data but only 200Mn users are consuming videos on platforms like YouTube and Facebook. There is a huge gap of about 250 Mn+ users, people who have the Internet through their smartphones, but do not consume video content online owing to a few critical reasons: •	Typing and Searching on mobile is difficult. These users also find it difficult to type and search on the English keyboard. •	Deciding what to search is a problem for such users – they don’t prefer YouTube because they don’t know what to search there. They would want content to come to them rather than they going to the content. •	Content in regional language is a necessity and not a priority – India has 22 official languages with 8 languages comprising of 90% online content. The opportunity is to make this set of 250Mn+ users video friendly, by bringing the content of their interests and in their native language to them.

Fidelis,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fidelis,"CRM, EdTech, Education, SaaS","Fidelis has launched a Learning Relationship Management (LRM) product that is in use by public companies and major universities. We are in the early growth stages of taking our product to market and are hiring.  LRM is a new category of product that fills a major void in the education technology market by helping organizations to organize complex learning relationships and ensure that all learners benefit from them.  Student Information Systems and Learning Management Systems are essential to execute the transactions of modern education and they drive efficiency and standardization. But they do so at the expense of relationships.  And we think that relationships are absolutely essential to learning. People are motivated to learn because the content is related to their long term goals. They learn in context of their relationships with peers, teachers, mentors, and a community of other learners. They learn because they want to progress and form relationships with companies and societies that require expertise and credentials.  If you analyze the most pernicious problems in education from the skills gap to attrition to professional development, you’ll find inadequate learning relationships to be at the root cause of everything.  Most learning organizations understand this and are trying to fill that relationship void with Customer Relationship Management software. But CRM is designed for sales and is insufficient to the task of managing learning relationships because CRMs treat the contact as a passive participant to be acted upon by sales people. Fidelis’ LRM recognizes that learners have to be active drivers of their own success and provides them a beautiful way to organize the relationships that they need to succeed.  Given how important learning is to every organization, to society, and to democracy, we think that someone is going to build a multi-billion dollar company selling LRMs - we hope it's us."

Built by people who have operated and ran financial departments of medium to Fortune 1,000 companies, we have first-hand experience on how important effective AR management is. Most times, it's the largest line item on a company's balance sheet -- if not managed properly, a company is bound to struggle.  Seeking short-term financing doesn't solve the inherent problem. It's expensive, renders control of customer relationships to a 3rd party, and forces companies into a viscous debt cycle. The truth is, there's a better, healthier, and more affordable way of accelerating cash flow. Managing AR the right way is the key.  Current Accounting / ERP systems are not built for managing AR, and current software products out there are clunky, archaic, and painful to use. As a result, businesses resort to excel spreadsheets and pen & paper when managing AR.  FundingGates' all-in-one AR Platform is different. It's been designed to provide a faster, smoother, and much more effective way of managing AR, giveing companies all the solutions they needs in one central place.  The software automatically prioritizes all outstanding customer accounts, and creates a workflow with calls, emails, and payment options that yield the highest ROI -- from a time savings and order-to-cash perspective. Decisions on the platform are entirely data-driven, which allows for a bullet-proof AR process -- essential to climb up the ""payment priority list"" of a customer.  FundingGates' AR Platform is optimized for success -- a team of AR Specialists will continuosly monitor our client's AR performance, and provide insightful and actionable recommendations. Clients also have the option to have our AR Specialists handle the entire AR management process for them, while giving them full visibilty and control (real time!) into all AR Management activities."

Their founders began searching for software capable of scheduling preventive maintenance to ensure energy savings, streamlining event scheduling to minimize the running time of HVAC systems, and tracking and responding to heating/cooling complaints to meet the needs of the school staff. Many of the software solutions they explored were feature rich but way too complicated.

After developing the first version of a tool to enhance the energy project, they realized the benefits that such a solution could provide to a wider customer base — and FMX was born!
