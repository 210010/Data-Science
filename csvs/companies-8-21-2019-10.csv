Craig Venter Institute is a world leader in genomic research. It was formed in October 2006 through the merger of several affiliated and legacy organizations â€” The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) and The Center for the Advancement of Genomics (TCAG), The J. Craig Venter Science Foundation, The Joint Technology Center, and the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives (IBEA). Today all these organizations have become one large multidisciplinary genomic-focused organization. With more than 400 scientists and staff, more than 250,000 square feet of laboratory space, and locations in Rockville, Maryland and San Diego, California. For more than two decades Dr. J. Craig Venter and his research teams have been pioneers in genomic research. The revolution began in 1991 when at the National Institutes of Health Dr. Venter and his team developed expressed sequence tags (ESTs), a new technique to rapidly discover genes. Dr. Venter and his colleagues then started a new kind of not for profit research institute, The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). With the freedom to pursue any number of exciting avenues in the burgeoning field of genomics, the team decided to use their new computing and computational tools, as well as new DNA sequencing technology, to sequence the first free living organism, Haemophilus influenzae in 1995. With this advance, the floodgates of genomics were opened. TIGR went on to sequence and analyze more than 50 microbial genomes. Dr. Venter and some from his team moved into mammalian genomics and sequenced some of the most important model organisms including the fruit fly, mouse and rat. The worldâ€™s attention was perhaps most keenly focused on the sequencing and analysis of one genome â€” the human â€” which was published in 2001 by Dr. Venter and his team at Celera Genomics. In the past three years teams have been engaged in some of the most fruitful and exciting research in the biological sciences. Weâ€™ve recently published the first diploid human genome and the initial results of our global ocean sampling expedition which uncovered more than six million new genes and thousands of new protein families from organisms found in sea water. Teams have also sequenced the microbial flora found in human environments such as the vagina, oral cavity and human gut. Weâ€™re making steady progress in our quest to create a synthetic chromosome and organism having successfully transformed one species of bacteria into another. Weâ€™ve also sequenced a variety of important infectious disease agents such as the mosquito species, Aedes aegypti, and we are working to understand the evolution of several viral genomes such as influenza and coronavirus in our quest to help alleviate the scourge of infectious disease around the world."

Its primary focus is on household IoT products i.e. Gas Leakage Alarms, Home Appliance Control, Access Control and Security devices, Health-Care devices etc. JolPi is rapidly prototyping on electronic products to build a global brand. JolPi is committed to create life changing products that will provide innovative solutions to critical problems. “We put meaning into things and that give people a reason to own our product and feel proud of it”, this is how Reza Ul Kabir the founder and CEO of JolPi summarized the company. Problem Statement ------------------------------- Based on a report from Titas the number of accident caused by gas leakage is more than 5000 a year. That means in every two hours one accident is taking place at homes across major cities of Bangladesh.  The country has seen a very low progress in the development of electronics industry. This can be attributed to our reluctance in venturing into electronics industry to produce advanced and original products locally.  Solution ------------- We have rolled out our very own gas leakage detector called “Sniffer” in three different variations which can avert potentially fatal accidents by detecting gas leakage within the quickest possible time.  To address our people’s lack of passion to pursue electrical engineering in Bangladesh, we are assiduously working to build a completely local electronics company that will instill the belief in others that we possess the capacity to produce advanced and original electronic hardware in Bangladesh. We have a billion dollar hardware market in the country, and our aim is to make low cost products with impeccable quality that will help us be a profitable venture. Company Overview ------------------------------- JolPi was founded in 2015 by Reza Ul Kabir as a part time electronic R&D and eventually became a full time dedicated business from August 2016. After getting huge attention with its initial R&D activities JolPi finally incorporated as ‘JolPi Electronics Ltd’ in 2017. In the initial 2 years JolPi spent all its effort building its capacity and search for a right product market fit and decided to work on IoT based Smart Home Safety Security and Healthcare Device. JolPi started with a R&D heavy product called ‘xS1’ an IoT based access and appliance control device. Although the sophisticated technology of ‘xS1’ quickly drew the attention of  local and international technology fascinated audience, it turned out to be an investment hungry product for the early stage of the company. After more than six months of hard work JolPi decided to postpone its release date and reschedule for one of its MVP called Sniffer, a gas leakage alarm for kitchen. This major decision brought  great opportunities for the company to achieve huge success. The product was released very quickly and sold out at its pre-order campaign within the first few weeks.   Achievement/Traction/Milestones ------------------------------------------------------- After releasing the first product of JolPi in Jan 2017, the company has received enormous response from the market and the tech community  which has enabled it to reach great heights in a short period of time. Oct 2017: JolPi has received partnership offer from Amazon for its AWS IoT platform and other services.  Oct  2017: JolPi has signed up a partnership with Grameenphone Ltd to co-brand and market its SIM based IoT products together.

Johari Shop,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/johari-shop,"E-Commerce, Fashion, Internet, Jewelry, Lifestyle, Precious Metals","Introduction: Johari Shop intends to disrupt the current disconnect that lies in an online jewellery buying experience by perfectly blending the trust in the offline retail world with the ease and convenience of online discovery. Johari Shop wants to provide customers with the largest selection of precious jewellery at a marketplace of numerous manufacturers in India with in store previews and 'touch n feel' experience before purchase at our strategically chosen partner stores. Gap: 1. In India with such high regional preferences in designs, selection is the biggest problem in offline jewellery buying. Offline channel can't solve it due to physical and monetary limitations, current online players solve it to a level but it is woefully inadequate as vertical destinations (BlueStone, CaratLane) have their own designs and manufacturing so selection is curtailed there. Horizontal players ( Flipkart, Snapdeal) can't provide a good jewellery buying experience which is very much evident by the fact that the vertical players sell 12 times more than the horizontal players.  2. Even though the pricing and selection in onine jewellery is relatively better but still the online shoppers  tend to have a cold feet when making the actual purchase. How can people spend thousands of dollars on such an intimate shopping experience without even handling the merchandise. 'Touch n feel' is one of the most important parameter after selection. Online players cannot address this and offline players have an edge here."

As a controller I was paired up with a GM to run the day to day operations of an auto mall with four franchises. Later as a CFO, the vice president and I ran the day to day operations of nine franchises in Chicago. During these seventeen years, I became involved in buy/sells, advertising, HR, bank relations, factory relations, legal, contracts and selling processes. During this time I would educate and train all department heads on the financial statement and forecasting. Due to the retirement of the dealer, I became the vice-president/GM of a single point Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram store. I was involved with the entire process of opening a new store. From getting factory approval, naming the store, website design and hiring all personnel. The dealer lived 1500 miles from store so I was the operator. While the VP, I learned the used car business by attending auctions and buying and selling vehicles, displaying vehicles on the lot and setting up a photo studio on the premise for high quality pictures. Additionally I spent most mornings on the service drive to improve service writer performance and customer satisfaction. Lastly I implemented a menu system in F&I that improved the dollars per unit by $250 and started a BDC. After about five years as the VP, I took on the largest challenge of my professional career. I moved across country to Las Vegas and became the GM of Towbin Dodge. During my first full year, 2013, I took them to the number one Dodge volume store in the country.
