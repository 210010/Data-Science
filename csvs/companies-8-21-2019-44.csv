Semantic Software’s Platform encompasses the tools required to build a Semantic Computing solution with data connectivity and productivity suites. This unique platform of component technologies allows users to create semantically enriched data, collected from various data sources, that a computer can understand meaning and context of. This allows the computer it to do much of the heavy lifting of data analysis. Organisations will benefit from this platform by utilising computer generated knowledge from active agents to allow researchers, analysts and management to make better quality decisions. The platform’s components can be deployed individually or as a fully integrated suite, either on premise or through a SaaS offering. To protect our technologies, Semantic Software has built a substantive patent portfolio since our founding in 2001."

Seno Medical Instruments,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/seno-medical-instruments-inc,"Health Care, Health Diagnostics, Medical Device","Seno Medical, Inc. was formed to commercialize a new modality in cancer screening and diagnosis: opto-acoustic imaging. Unlike most screening techniques, which rely on anatomical imaging, Seno's goal is to bring functional imaging that can detect angiogenesis to the marketplace. Our first product is a small animal imaging device. This product application was successfully licensed to a world market leader, VisualSonics. Products for use with humans, focusing initially on breast cancer, are also in development. Seno’s first clinical application is for breast cancer diagnosis. A strong, experienced management team and nationally recognized Scientific Advisory Board have been assembled to complete the commercialization, secure regulatory approval and launch the products. The management team has a long history of working together and in successfully commercializing medical devices. Seno’s patented technology integrates the use of lasers and acoustics to determine the presence of angiogenesis—the growth of blood vessels and higher blood volume that always surrounds a tumor. This represents a significant evolutionary step in imaging. Unlike anatomical imaging techniques, such as mammography, laser opto-acoustic imaging can detect breast cancer, for example, at its earliest clinically significant stage (2 mm. versus 10 mm. with mammography) without patient discomfort or exposure to harmful x-ray. The opportunities are exciting…for investors and scientists, for physicians and the myriad women and men tested for or diagnosed with cancer each year. The goal of laser opto-acoustic imaging is to allow more precise and earlier detection of smaller tumors and the ability to differentiate benign from malignant growth without biopsy. Future applications will focus on other types of cancer and broader diagnostic and treatment applications. Seno acquired working pre-prototypes in addition to the core patents on opto-acoustic technology; we will license two other patents for future applications. These patents constitute a platform technology with a multitude of potential follow-on applications, including imaging for the earliest detection of cancer of the ovary, bladder, prostate, colon and melanoma as well as unstable plaque (cardiovascular). Peer review and the continued funding of $13 million from nationally recognized institutions such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Department of Defense (DoD) support our scientific credibility. And, significantly, the pre-prototypes being used in clinical testing have demonstrated a strong correlation to biopsy in diagnosing cancer. We look forward to the future and to the role Seno can play in minimizing the uncertainty, the cost and trauma of diagnosing and treating cancer."

After that it's all the usual process -- set appointments, get quotes and hope you are getting a good deal. In fact, chances are, you are not, because contractors often give you a price based on their perception of how much you can afford to pay. You can save 30-40% on almost any project, but for that you need to meet with probably 10 or more contractors, for which most homeowners just don't have time.  With ServiceWhale, you take several minutes to choose what exactly you need to do (e.g. what kind of new heating / cooling system you want, or what kind of new roof or new floor) and then you instantly see custom quotes from all contractors ready to do this for you -- with prices! You don't even have to provide your contact information. Pretty much like on Amazon, when you shop for a new TV -- no calls or meetings needed. Then, if you like any of the quotes, you can ask the contractor(s) any questions you may have, also online, and order the service. You don't have to pay for it upfront, except for a small refundable booking deposit (never to exceed $50). By the way, all quotes on ServiceWhale are discounted, because we save contractors a lot of time and money -- they don't have to spend half a day for coming to your home for an estimate, without even knowing if they'll get your business or not.  ServiceWhale is 100% free for homeowners. We are paid by contractors, but only for the actual orders (no fees for leads).

Secfense,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/secfense,"Information Technology, Software","We protect companies by enabling any 2fa on any application in just minutes. Why does that even matter? Because credential theft kills companies and passwords are the root of all evil. People are lousy in remembering complex and unique passwords. We usually come up with one password to use anywhere with just slight variations. This makes us an easy target for an attack.   When one of your passwords leaks, it can be instantly used (with all possible variations) on other platforms (including corporate accounts).  In 2017 more than 80% of all breaches involved weak or stolen credentials. Passwords should have been made obsolete years ago, but somehow they're still stuck with us.  As a result of obvious password flaws, two-factor authentication (2FA) has been introduced and drastically increased protection against phishing and credential theft. 2FA came in a form of the one-time SMS passwords, smartphone apps, physical security keys or biometrics. So why hasn’t 2FA become a default for all my apps yet? Because there used to be enormous barriers of adoption 2FA into the organization, especially at big heterogenous environments.  Enabling 2FA required pricey development or consulting work.  It increased overall complexity or was even impossible to introduce due to the sensitive nature of an application.  Most of the times companies had to select only the critical apps and enabled 2FA only there, leaving password-based access as a default. We've decided to change that.  We want to help companies make strong 2FA a new default of security policies.  And to do that we had to completely redefine the paradigm of 2FA deployment.  What SF did to 2FA is what VMware has done to infrastructure. By introducing an intermediary 2FA layer, we created independence, flexibility, and scalability. Companies can now upgrade their global security policies easily and make 2FA a new default. No developers, no contractors, no third-party code inside applications, no vendor-locks. Also, Secfense has no restrictions when it comes to verticals. A strong 2FA intermediary layer can be easily introduced in finance, insurance, utilities, healthcare, e-commerce, transportation etc.  The bigger the company, the more burning the issue is."

Semafo,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/semafo,"Financial Services, Mining Technology, Precious Metals","SEMAFO’s corporate vision – establish enduring relationships with the countries in which we operate and through our experience, expertise and financial acumen, partner to responsibly develop natural resources – showcases the Canadian company’s association of sustainable development with geological and mining development. The spirit of this mission forms a thread that runs throughout our history.  In 1993, Benoit La Salle, founder of SEMAFO, was on a philanthropic mission in Africa when the authorities in Burkina Faso proposed that he return in order to help realise the untapped mineral potential in the country. SEMAFO, which results from the amalgamation of three small exploration companies, was incorporated two years later in order to launch the mining sector in Burkina Faso. The name SEMAFO is an acronym for Société d’Exploration Minière en Afrique de l’Ouest, the French version of our former name “West Africa Mining Exploration Corporation”. From the outset, the Corporation’s modus operandi was closely aligned with the founder’s humanitarian vision of West Africa as evidenced by an early corporate commitment: “We are committed to conducting our business activities in a manner that promotes sustainable development and an improvement in the social welfare of the regions in which we operate.” This dual mission remains at the core of our business and took deeper roots through the 2008 establishment of SEMAFO Foundation, a non-profit, stand-alone charitable organisation that supports communities and offers an improved quality of life to regions where SEMAFO is present. Through its three-pronged approach – education, healthcare and income-generating - the Foundation aims to help local communities reach their greatest potential. By guiding communities in income-generating activities, the Foundation ensures that stakeholders will continue to benefit from our legacy even when the company’s mining activities will have ceased. In a history that spans some twenty years, SEMAFO has successfully commissioned three gold mines in several jurisdictions in West Africa and produced more than two million ounces in gold. Our in-house development, construction, operational, administrative and government relations teams, all of whom are fluent French speakers, draw from more than a decade of operating experience in West Africa. Our success has been governed by the values we practice: respect and integrity, excellence, know-how and teamwork.  Our portfolio has evolved and simplified since 1995 when we held 19 exploration permits in four West African countries. In 1995, Les Minéraux SGV S.A., a company in which we were a 50% equity partner, purchased a two-year prospecting permit for the Jean Gobélé project in Guinea. With the financial support and technical expertise of our then major shareholder Managem S.A., and in collaboration with our co-licensee Corporation Minière Afcan, the project was advanced from exploration, site development and mine construction until its first gold pour on April 25, 2002. The name of the mine was subsequently changed to the Kiniero gold mine, which we operated for eleven years. In 2013, the mine was deemed a non-core asset and placed in care and maintenance until its 2014 divestiture to a local mining company. In 1999, we entered Niger by setting up la Société des Mines du Liptako S.A. (SML). Through the support of Managem, we advanced the Libiri and Samira Hill gold deposits through development, mine construction and to commercial production in October 2004. We operated the Samira Hill Mine for nine years, improving plant availability and capacity, and enabling the mine to produce over 540,000 ounces of gold before its 2013 disposal to SOPAMIN. Mana, which lies at the heart of SEMAFO’s history, was a grassroots discovery that has now evolved into the third-largest gold mine in Burkina Faso. We advanced this project from satellite image interpretation through detailed exploration, site development and mine construction to its first gold pour in March 2008. Since then, we have expanded the processing plant four times. Since November 1999, we have drilled more than 1.2 million metres on the extensive Mana property that boasts a total surface area of over 2,675 square kilometres on the Houndé Gold Belt. In 2014, the Corporation marked another milestone when it took the high-grade Siou deposit from blind discovery to production in a mere 18 months, thereby boosting Mana production and reserve grade. Our history shows we have been a pioneer in many aspects in West Africa. The original gold mine operator in Niger, SEMAFO also spearheaded foreign direct investment in the gold mining sector in Burkina Faso, and remains the only mining company in Burkina Faso to establish a non-profit foundation and pledge up to 2% of its net profits to support its efforts in the community. Following its 2015 acquisition of 13 Orbis permits, SEMAFO’s property portfolio reached 7,600 square kilometers, comprising one of the most extensive land positions in Burkina Faso. Our strategy of quality ounces, cost control and optimisation programs, and disciplined exploration at Mana took us into a new phase of development in 2014, allowing us to generate free cash flow even in a soft gold environment. Driven by the performance of our recently ramped-up high-grade Siou and Fofina deposits, we produced 234,300 ounces at a total cash cost of $649 per ounce in 2014, thus meeting production guidance for the seventh consecutive year. Although we take pride in our solid financial, operational and community report cards, we remain focused on future expansion of our heritage. Our commitment to building an ethical, reputable, world-class gold company through a combination of exploration, development and acquisition remains undimmed."

In Pharma, there are always high risks of missing valuable R&D targets or investing into products which will fail. The reason is in a variety of factors which influence the success of drug candidates. Such factors include safety and efficacy issues, patient and doctor convenience, pipelines of competitors, manufacturing cost, and many others. That’s why a thorough scientific due diligence is needed before a pharmaceutical company or biotech venture fund makes a decision to invest into a new candidate. R&D experts have to analyze huge volumes of information in order to get “the funnel” of promising candidates or to qualify the specific investment target. Semantic Hub accelerates the search, qualification, and evaluation of candidates tenfolds. Thus, an expert is able to analyze 1000 candidates instead of 10. Semantic Hub service is based on natural language processing (NLP) and the elements of artificial intelligence. It provides: automated scanning of Internet and databases and “reading” millions of documents for the identification of those containing right information within a variety of sources; deeper semantic analysis of the thousands of relevant scientific papers, conference posters, clinical trial results, data on drug pipelines, press-releases, etc. – in order to pull out the most up-to-date and relevant information; generation of insights on all the important factors. The NLP is based on the domain ontologies developed by Semantic Hub which specify concept types: important factors, objects and events. Semantic analysis makes it possible to identify such concepts in the processed documents in all kinds of linguistic varieties including mentionings of new, previously unknown objects of interest."

Airlines are faced with growing direct costs and restricted growth. Baggage touches both pain points; representing a direct cost in terms of fuel, landing duties and handling costs & an indirect cost as a barrier to turning around more planes within the limited daily slots. To combat the cost of handling baggage, airlines are seeking to reduce the amount checked whilst charging significantly more for that which is. The CEO of Europe's largest low cost airline has stated he will “price luggage out of the hold”.  Baggage however is not only a problem for European low cost airlines; in the last decade the revenue achieved from baggage fees in the USA has grown from $400M to $4B. One journalist described the modern traveller as being fleeced like sheep and herded like cattle,  checked baggage fees are growing, hand luggage only flights are coming and baggage allowances are falling; despite this over 1.5 billion flights will be taken in 2014.

Not long ago, Bill experienced a series of health issues that forced him to rely on his personal Medicare Supplement Insurance. With a heart surgery, emergency appendicitis, open heart surgery and a knee surgery all in a two year period, Bill quickly exceeded his Medicare coverage, with bills totaling well over $400,000. Click for a look at Bill’s medical bill. “It was unbelievable!” Bill laughs. “I have been so healthy for my whole life, but in that short period of time I was hit from every direction, and I would have had to pay almost half a million dollars in medical bills, if I didn’t have Medicare and my Medicare Supplement Insurance plan. Instead, I paid nearly nothing. More than ever before, I see the value we provide to our customers at SeniorQuote.” In the early 1970s, Bill worked with the Waddell and Reed life insurance model which promoted low cost term life insurance in place of higher cost whole life insurance with the proposition that the difference in premium (premium savings) should be invested in mutual funds for retirement. In the 1980s, Bill was a founder of SelectQuote Insurance Services, one of the first life insurance agencies to offer a term life insurance quote comparison service. The SelectQuote service was designed to assist people by providing affordable rates available from highly-rated life insurance companies. In the 1990s, Bill was a founder of First Union Insurance Services, which offered affordable term life and permanent insurance to support the needs of the bank’s many customers. For the past ten years, Bill has keenly focused on the needs of Baby Boomers; helping them to replace their term life insurance with affordable permanent life insurance; and helping them sort through their Medicare and Medicare Supplement options as they approach the mandatory Medicare age of 65. A senior himself, Bill has become an advocate for seniors.

SensArs,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sensars,"Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Health Care, Medical, Medical Device, Neuroscience","There are almost 5 millions of amputees, and even more nerve-injured persons, only in the USA and Europe. Together with commonly present neuropathic pain, and lost limb function (nerve injuries), they have no perception or control of the force required to hold or pick up objects and cannot feel their shape or consistency (when using prostheses). A century after the first prosthesis, electrodes, electronics and surgical expertise can be merged into the life-changing solution. Our venture is a synergistic effort converging expertise from microtechnologies, algorithms, electronics and clinical experimentation. We are an EPFL-based startup, founded by Francesco Petrini, Stanisa Raspopovic, and Silvestro Micera. Our mission is to re-enable upper, lower-limb amputees and nerve-damaged persons by: Restoring their complete sensory-motor functionality. Diminishing phantom limb pain. Enabling them to feel the artificial limb as part of their own body. From a market viewpoint, the nerve-injured persons do not have effective ways for function restoration, so we are proposing a novel tech and therefore generating a new market. As for amputees, the prosthetic limbs are getting more sophisticated but lack sensory feedback. We are constructing the game-changing functional improvement of the technology that will become the essential feature of the next-generation of prosthesis. Amputees and peripheral nerve damaged persons are in constant increase, mainly due to diabetes, car accidents, work injuries and wars. Among the most disabling consequences of these is the interruption of sensations flow from extremities to the brain.  The absence of feedback and the perception of prosthesis as a foreign body are the primary reason for refusal to use prosthesis. Amputees cannot feel the shape or material of objects they are holding and have no perception of the force required to hold or pick up objects. Nerve-injured persons often have completely functionally unusable limbs. In 50-80% of cases, amputees and nerve-injured experience neuropathic pain from the missing part of the limb and drugs do not provide adequate relief. Providing them with an adequate sensory feedback would solve their problems."
