It also offers products including home decor, accessories, health & lifestyle product, fashion, electronics, toys & games, furniture, beauty, grocery & liquor, appliances, and sportswear. Founded in 2006 by brothers Gabby and Hezi Leibovich, the idea for CatchOfTheDay was born from a desire to bring fun back to shopping. Bored with catalog-based online shopping sites that were prevalent in the early days of online retail, the Leibovich brothers sought a better way to harness the power of the Internet to give shoppers a compelling reason to buy online. The reason: amazing deals. The how: pioneering the daily deal “flash sale” retailing model in Australia. With word of mouth and social media fuelling demand as customers turned to social networking sites to share their latest buy with friends, the Group quickly expanded into new niche categories with dedicated online shopping stores; building size while at the same time fostering powerful economies around core operations in technology, deal sourcing, warehousing and logistics. This provided the Group with an agile and lean platform to support profitable growth and expansion into new markets, while at the same time maintaining a compelling price advantage.  In May 2011, less than five years from founding its first site CatchOfTheDay, the Group received $80M in funding for a 40% share from a consortium of investors including Tiger Global management (investors in Facebook, Zynga and LinkedIn), James Packer's Consolidated Press Holdings and Andrew Bassat from SEEK. The deal was ranked by the Internet Deal Book as the 12th largest e-commerce transaction for 2011 and helped open doors to the additional skills and knowledge needed to take the business to the next level. Recognizing the power of the deal. Today, The Catch Group has evolved from its clearance sale roots to offering brands a compelling retail solution to market their goods to a captive 3.5 million member base, which grows by roughly 30,000 every week. The Group regularly receives over 1 million visits to its websites in a day (24 hours), with one item sold across the group every 1 second. Its record-setting deals include 220,000 units of Ferrero Rocher chocolates sold in 8 hours and 675,000 Hungry Jack’s $2 meal deal vouchers in 48 hours. Its highest rate of revenue was $1 million per hour on Samsung LCD TVs. In an increasingly competitive marketplace for deals, this gives the Group a huge advantage over other competitors as well as scope to cross-sell and market new initiatives across its sites. Building towards the future Catch.com.au  is serious about carving new ground in Australia’s retailing sector, and as such it wants to be recognized as a serious player in retail as a whole, not just the online space. The Group believes that the future of its business won't be about definitions like ‘group buying, ‘daily deals’ or ‘online stores’: it will be about retail, and choosing the best platforms to meet the future needs of shoppers. Today, Catch.com.au  employs more than 800 staff and for financial year 2011/2012 recorded very strong growth in both sales and profit despite considerable investment in new warehousing technologies, senior personnel and strengthening its core operations. The Group has revealed gross retail receipts from its businesses of circa $350M for the 2013 financial year and expects to maintain ongoing double-digit growth for many years to come. Intent on remaining Australia’s largest online retail group, profitable growth and expanding into new markets will continue to be key themes for the Catch Group as it continues to build out its portfolio of category-leading online shopping stores."

Cape Wind,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cape-wind,"Energy, Renewable Energy, Wind Energy","Cape Wind's developer is Energy Management Inc. (EMI) a New England based energy company with 35 years of experience in energy conservation and energy development. ESS Group, Inc. of Waltham, Massachusetts, has been the environmental science specialist for the project. Cape Wind is also being assisted by Woods Hole Group, K2 Management, SgurrEnergy, AWS Truepower, and PMSS. Barclays is Cape Wind’s Financial Advisor.  In 1975, Energy Management, Inc. (EMI) began developing energy conservation and pollution control projects for institutional and industrial facilities. In 1985, the company transitioned to developing independent power projects. The company has successfully developed six natural gas fired electric generation projects. Over the past thirty-five years EMI earned a reputation of completing environmentally superior facilities with ultra-high plant availability. Since 2001, EMI has been focused primarily on developing renewable energy projects including offshore wind, biomass, and solar.  Cape Wind will produce 75% of the electricity used on Cape Cod and the Islands of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket in average conditions, with zero pollutant emissions, zero waste discharge, and zero water consumption.  Cape Wind will help launch the American offshore wind industry and produce significant economic, environmental, and energy benefits for Massachusetts, the region, and the nation.  Cape Wind will consist of 130 Siemens 3.6-megawatt offshore wind turbines with a capacity of 468 megawatts.  The project will be located in Federal waters off the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, on Horseshoe Shoal in Nantucket Sound, the most technically optimal offshore wind power site in the United States.  Cape Wind’s monopile foundations are individually designed and will be driven deep into the seabed to support the wind turbines.  Transition pieces will be fitted onto the monopiles.  The wind turbine towers will be bolted onto the transition pieces.  Intra array submarine cables will be jet plowed six feet into the seabed and will feed into an Electric Service Platform (ESP) near the center of the wind farm array.  From the ESP, export submarine cables will be submerged and make landfall in West Yarmouth, where buried cables will continue to the interconnect point, the Barnstable Substation.  Cape Wind’s Operations Headquarters will be based along Falmouth Harbor on Cape Cod.  Horseshoe Shoal in Nantucket Sound has all of the characteristics to be the optimal location for America’s first offshore wind farm.  This location also makes good sense thinking about both the past and the future of the Cape and Islands.  Not only do the Cape and Islands have a rich history of harnessing wind power, but they now stand to benefit by being a leader in clean energy production to mitigate the impacts of climate change, to which the Cape and Islands are particularly vulnerable."

This project is the expression of a passion that I developed for all the alternative medicines and practices (CAM) that have allowed me to grow, become a better version of myself and find my vocation, my mission, my Ikigai. Through my personal holistic healing experiences I benefited from the guidance and support of many talented practitioners, but I figured that it was really time and energy consuming to find and identify which practice can best suit the situation you’re going through. I also observed that for those who aren’t part of an already connected community, it could even be very discouraging to go through this process of finding the best practitioners. This is how I envisioned this opportunity. After a long reflection on my mission and how could I best contribute to make the greatest social impact while still having fun and enjoying what I’m doing, I decided to initiate a community dedicated to connect and reinforce synergies between all CAM practitioners and their patients. My vision is to inspire a healthier everyday life for as many people as possible through a more holistic and integrative approach to their health. In today’s modern society, human beings have never been exposed to such a high level of stress, useless information’s and expectations. According to the WHO, mental illness will soon become the world’s first health issue. I believe that it is essential to encourage and support people to reconnect with themselves and that a more holistic healthcare could offer an efficient solution to positively improve mental health. I am confident that this will also help people raising their ecological consciousness. I found a lot of inspiration for this project in my many Burning Man experiences."

An essential USP of CargoSteps is the cross company functionality with multiple parties of every size.

Early games include slalom skiing, trivia quizzes, colouring in pictures, and Olympic sprint races.

Its initial line of business was research and development contract work for defence laboratories in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. In 2003, an Australian defence research project linking moving map technology with advanced EO/IR turret control, and coupled with video display and processing, led to the conception of AIMS-ISR®, a product which had immediate and far-reaching impact due to the ease with which track data from other sensors can be integrated into the operational picture. The commercial and military success of AIMS-ISR® led to a number of large-scale projects that firmly established CarteNav's technical expertise as well as an approach based on creating solutions that are easy to use, highly intuitive, and maximize the performance of operational teams and existing hardware. Today, CarteNav is an international leader in situational awareness solutions for the maritime, land, and air environments. Its flagship product, AIMS-ISR®, is the result of thousands of hours of operational testing and is in use in a growing list of countries worldwide. It has become the software of choice for both government and non-government agencies on more than 25 different platforms in more than 17 countries across 4 continents. A sister product, AIMS-HD, provides a cost-effective, and readily available COTS solution, designed to leverage and enhance the functionality of EO/IR cameras.

Cardia,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cardia,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Medical, Medical Device","Cardia, Inc. is an innovative company engaged in developing, manufacturing and marketing transcatheter septal occluders. To date we have closed over 15,000 septal defects worldwide. Ultrasept, our latest family of products, serves as our 7th generation of septal closure devices. The dual articulating sails allow for easy deployment of the devices and create a super low profile within the atria. Ultrasept devices boast a simple, hands-free loading feature and are fully retrievable before and after release. Ultrasept products include double-round devices for the percutaneous closure of both PFO’s (Patent Foramen Ovale) and ASD’s (Atrial Septal Defect). A septal occluder is a cardiac implant that fixes a cardiac defect commonly referred to as a “hole in the heart."" Our devices are delivered through a catheter by an interventional cardiologist and only take about 30 minutes to implant. Many patients are admitted to the hospital in the morning and return home that afternoon or the next day without the lengthy recovery periods often needed after open-heart surgery. The market for our septal occluder products revolves around the need to close or fix a number of both pediatric and adult cardiac defects. The PFO (Patent Foramen Ovale) defect appears to occur in approximately 25% of the adult population. Most people have no symptoms and therefore require no treatment; however, it is now believed that about 250,000-1,000,000 cases worldwide per year may require closure. These people initially experience a cryptogenic stroke and upon follow up with their neurologist are revealed to have a PFO defect. If the defect is not closed, these patients are subject to repeated strokes. Similarly, ASD’s (Atrial Septal Defect) appear in approximately 100,000-150,000 cases per year worldwide. Over time, if the defect is left unrepaired, serious cardiac problems can arise. Another possible application for the Ultrasept PFO devices is with regards to the relationship between PFO’s and migraine headaches. Presently it is known that approximately 50% of all migraine sufferers have a PFO. Clinical Studies are currently underway to confirm this relationship of PFO’s and migraine headaches."
