"LetinAR Co., Ltd.",https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/letinar-co-ltd,"Augmented Reality, Hardware, Virtual Reality, Wearables","LetinAR develops an optical system for AR smart glasses, which plays the same role as smartphone displays. The optical system consists of LetinAR’s self-developed “Pin Mirror (“PinMR™”) lens” and a microdisplay made by external partners. Current smart glasses manufacturers use traditional optical systems such as Half-mirror, Diffractive Optical Elements (DOEs), and waveguides to build the devices. Under-par performance of those optical systems has hardly satisfied users and experts. The bulky body, narrow Field of View (FOV), complicated manufacturing process, and inaccurate color expression have long been a stumbling block for successful commercialization of AR smart glasses.  LetinAR’s PinMR™” lens is set to replace such displays. The company has applied the so-called “Pinhole Effect” to tiny mirrors and embedded them with eyeglass lenses. Respective PinMR™ reflects the light from a microdisplay and guides the light into human pupils. Users may view the virtual image from the microdisplay as well as the image from the real world at ease. Human eyes cannot detect the mirrors because the mirrors are smaller than human pupils. Only the virtual image formed by the light reflected by those mirrors becomes visual.  With LetinAR PinMR™ lens, smart glasses manufacturers can build smart glasses worn like a pair of conventional glasses. The simple structure of PinMR™ Lens module can facilitate mass production. PinMR™ Lens shows wider virtual screen than the currently available optical systems while more accurately expressing colors – an edge over diffraction-based or refraction-based systems from competitors. PinMR™ Lens can also show a clear image without inducing dizziness because it is able to extend the Depth of Field (DOF) multiple times.  LetinAR plans to supply PinMR™ Lens as a complete module, which consists of PinMR™ lens and a microdisplay from external partners. LetinAR will begin providing PinMR™ Lens samples next year, making it possible for smart glasses manufacturers to evaluate the potential of using PinMR™ lens for their own products.  Based in Seoul, South Korea, the company was founded in October 2016. It has raised $700,000 seed money from Naver, the biggest portal site and search engine operator in South Korea. LetinAR went on to receive $3.6 million in Series A funding from another internet giant, Kakao Ventures."

Yet, perfectly good applicants are regularly declined due to blemished credit, student status, or other factors that do not impact their ability to pay. That’s where Leap helps. Our proprietary underwriting tools allow for quick and thorough vetting of potential residents which expands a landlord’s pool of qualified tenants and eliminates default risk.  There is no cost to the landlord as the one-time, upfront fee is paid by the resident and secures rental income for the entire term of the lease. Further, Leap accepts applications from tenants before they begin their apartment search, pre-approving them up to a certain monthly rent amount and delivering qualified residents directly to landlords.  Our goal is to improve the financial performance of landlords while helping people qualify for better apartments.   Our application takes 4 minutes to complete and can be submitted on a phone, tablet, or computer, and approvals take just 30 minutes during business hours. Furthermore, Leap can pre-approve renters for a maximum monthly rental amount for free. That way if you haven’t found an apartment yet, it’s easier to know what to look for. With Leap, renters can get the apartment they want, not just the one landlords say they qualify for. No apartment is out of reach, and that is a guarantee. Visit us at www.leapeasy.com to see how easy it is to get the apartment of your dreams!"

Let Me Drive,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/let-me-drive,"Taxi Service, Travel","LetMeDrive is a technology driven ‘Self-Drive & Chauffeur Driven Car Rental’ service provider. It is presently functional in Delhi NCR and Chandigarh. It provides cars on rent, with or without driver, depending on the needs of the customer. The online taxi-booking business in India has two segments. One is ‘Self-Drive Car Rental’ where the customer rents the car and drives himself. Other is ‘Chauffeur driven Car Rental’ where the customer gets the car with driver. The chauffeur driven car rental in India is overcrowded with unorganized players like tourist taxis & tours and travel companies. LetMeDrive initially started with ‘Self-Drive Car Rentals’. The idea of this venture was conceived in December 2013, when Founders, Nimish Agrawal and Navendu Saxena realized that booking cars has become an everyday essential. Hence, the exigency of an easy, independent and affordable medium of travelling led to the inception of Let Me Drive. Recently LetMeDrive also started with their chauffeur driven services where they have created a marketplace of individual drivers, while the drivers are benefitted by setting their own prices, customers have an advantage of choosing the driver and car they want on the basis of price, driver rating & reviews and car images. Hence giving the choice to the drivers and customers for their feasibility. The Journey: Agrawal & Saxena are alumni of Delhi College of Engineering. Nimish and Navendu were both placed in MNCs (Nimish has over 4 years of experience working in the IT industry with the companies Aricent and Aristocrat and Navendu has worked with the Bank of America) but decided to leave their jobs to pursue their startup dream when later they realized the need of self-drive car rental in India and started with LetMeDrive. As of now, LetMeDrive is self-funded venture. Fortunately, it has started receiving a lot of inbound VC interest and has gained substantial traction in the market. ""The dream of starting our company with this concept was always over our minds and we're glad we've reached until here. To family, its never an impressive idea when young kids talk about starting their own venture and that too when its technology based. Fortunately, we've managed to defy the odds till now"", adds Nimish. LetMeDrive has been so far completely bootstrapped. They are based out of Delhi and have a 15 people strong team. They are actively hiring for various positions in several departments. All the car bookings are done through the online portal www.letmedrive.in and through the app and payment can be done with all types of credit cards, debit cards and net banking. They provide cars on per day rent basis. Customers can pick the cars from the specific location or ask for a custom pick and drop. How LetMeDrive is different? Apart from being the cheapest and most convenient car rent portal, LetMeDrive is one of the few companies who are in to both Self-drive and Chauffeur Driven Car Services. The biggest problem the customer faces is that on websites and apps they are shown photoshoped & unrealistic pictures and when the car comes the bitter reality comes with it. Customer finds that the condition is not up to the mark and the car is not according to what was shown on the website/app. To overcome this issue LetMeDrive has come up with original car images. They are following “You get what you see” concept which sets them apart from their competitors. Secondly, customers also complain about the hidden charges (consists of Driver’s allowance and Travelling allowance). The customers are shown a specific rate and on that other charges are applied at the time of billing. LetMeDrive solves this problem too. There are no hidden costs. The customer has to pay according to what rates he sees. Also, other chauffeur driven competitors of LetMeDrive provides cars on daily basis while LetMeDrive provides cars on hourly basis and hence providing flexibility to the customer. This way customer would be at a benefit on the basis of prices too. The chauffeur driven rates are decided by the drivers we have on board and hence a concept of reverse bidding can be seen in this which in hand benefits the customer who gets the car at best available rates. The company also provides one way cab services to its customer so that it doesn’t has to pay for the entire round trip. And the company’s technology driven algorithm for one way service helps the driver to not go empty handed after completing the one way trip. Future Aspects: The company has recently diversified into chauffeur driven services. They plan to expand into other tier 1 and tier 2 cities in the next 3 months. They plan to have PAN India presence by the next year. The company also plans to increase their fleet to 2500 cars in the next 3 months and 10,000 cars in the next one year."

Due to the innovation of LEYE’s Founder and Chairman, Richard Melman, and his creative team of partners and employees, LEYE currently owns, licenses or manages more than 100 establishments in Illinois, California, Arizona, Maryland, Virginia, Minnesota and Nevada. The founding of LEYE was the result of joining Melman's food ideas with the confidence and support of Jerry A. Orzoff, Melman's first partner. A successful real estate agent and North Michigan Avenue haberdasher, Orzoff (who died in 1981 at the age of 45), played a crucial role in Melman's life as a friend and mentor. ""Jerry was a guy I respected and related to,"" says Melman. ""He believed in my ideas. Meeting him was the turning point in my life."" After meeting Melman for the first time in 1970, Orzoff liked his off-beat ideas, and believed in his ability. Working together as new friends and partners, Melman and Orzoff raised a total of $17,000 to create an upbeat eatery geared toward young singles interested in rock music, casual clothes and healthy food. Melman hired bright, attractive waitresses and bartenders and filled the location with hanging plants and modern artwork. The menu was designed to appeal to a variety of tastes, and included everything from vegetarian and macrobiotic foods to hamburgers, sandwiches, milkshakes and the first fruit and vegetable-laden salad bar. Melman and Orzoff paired their first initials, added the sound a pig makes when eating and baptized the establishment R.J. Grunts on June 10, 1971 in Chicago's Lincoln Park. Despite a lackluster response in the opening weeks, Orzoff provided the much needed confidence and enthusiasm to keep Melman optimistic until his dream became reality. After one month, Grunts became a success."

Legal.io,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/legal-io,"Legal, Legal Tech, Marketplace","Tony Lai and Pieter Gunst, cofounders of Legal.io, practiced and studied law for about two decades between them.

While emerging technologies opened up brand new economies and individuals became more interconnected than ever before, the legal landscape remained a tangled maze of sluggish bureaucracies. Few firms or legal service organizations were taking advantage of digital age resources, and as a result, clients seeking help often encountered long wait times and overpriced, poorly-matched providers. The two were in the midst of receiving a Master's Degree at Stanford University's Law, Science & Technology program in 2010, when they had an idea: why not use such fast-evolving systems to directly benefit the legal field? If no tools existed to help the legal industry succeed in the 21st century, they would build one themselves.
