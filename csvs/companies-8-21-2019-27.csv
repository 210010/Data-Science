Abstract,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/abstract,"Apps, Software, Web Apps, Web Design","Abstract is a design and workflow platform that helps designers work together. Abstract builds upon and extends the stable technology of Git to host and manage your work. In 2015, Josh (CEO) and Kevin (CTO) were working together at Habitat when the frequent game of “where’s the latest design” finally drove Kevin to ask, “Why don’t designers have proper version control?” Designers have always been a flexible bunch. Dedicated to bringing great ideas to life and willing to use every possible tool and jump through all kinds of hoops to get their work done. Unfortunately, too much of the design toolset is focused on creating isolated artifacts instead of supporting connected workflows. Designers need more support for half of their job that isn’t drawing shapes, choosing typefaces, or prototyping interactions. The majority of a design job is orchestrating the team, ensuring visual consistency, updating stakeholders, documenting decisions, interpreting feedback, and delivering the work for implementation. When you look at it this way, it becomes clear. We don’t need more visual design tools. We need help managing our work and how design relates to the rest of the organization. So began Abstract. The company's evolving answer to how we believe modern design teams will work. A collaborative, transparent, and effective way to design.   At Abstract, we are actively working to build a diverse and inclusive organization. Here, diversity includes age, economic class, educational background, ethnic variance, familial status, gender, gender expression, gender identity, marital status, national origin, religious affiliation, sex, sexual orientation, transgender status, or veteran status."

Aballoon,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/aballoon,"Blockchain, FinTech, Media and Entertainment, Music Label, Music Streaming, Social Network","Can you imagine a world where music is created and enjoyed by anyone and where a whole new economy is built upon this process?  Welcome to Aballoon, the first music collaboration platform, digital record label & mutual fund where artists & fans collaborate and create songs together, and where investors earn money by making this happen. Before getting into the securitization of our music royalties, I’m going to talk about our technology… We’ve built a platform that allows people from all around the globe to collaborate online through the beautiful craft of writing lyrics together, or just by writing and storing their lyrics privately. This platform is built in a way that allows us to develop internal applications like our unique music streaming service and our music encyclopedia, “Aballoopedia”. One of the best things about our platform is that it’s not only an entertainment music website where we distribute our content, it is also a space for creation & collaboration, and it functions like a social network that allows our users to share and dedicate their favorite songs from our catalog; which brings me to the next point… OUR CONTENT During the past 4 years, we’ve managed to discover and polish an outstanding formula to generate music content like no other… We have come up with a music collaboration model that even allows non-musicians to be part of music creation by writing lyrics on our platform and having well-known artists collaborate and create songs out of those lyrics through our record label, Weballooning…  And I know that you’re probably wondering what exactly is Weballooning... Weballooning is the name of our digital record label, which in other words means it is an asset generator!  Weballooning consists of arranging live music sessions where we gather musicians and artists from different bands and have them write and record a song within 48 hours, using some of the lyrics that their fans have posted on our platform. In other words, we’re the first digital record label to produce and sell music written between artists and fans. And believe me when I say that the results are mind-blowing. The sound of the songs is an unprecedented thing. We currently have more than 250,000 monthly listeners on Spotify and YouTube, and over 9.2 million plays with just 12 launched songs, and without any budget for marketing, which takes me to the next and probably the most important thing about this presentation: Music Backed Securities… We’ve already started collecting and managing music royalties out of our current songs catalog but we need liquidity to scale, That’s why after more than 2 decades of having such a financial instrument issued by David Bowie and financial innovator David Pullman, we want to retake the “Bowie Bonds” concept and turn it into the first Music Backed Securities market.  According to Billboard Magazine, Bowie Bonds were ahead of their time however, thanks to the re-emergence of the music industry and the rise of the Blockchain technology, we want to create the first financial market and mutual fund that issues and sells Asset Backed Securities collateralized by pools of songs and/or song derivatives that can serve as a new investment vehicle to be traded in our own platform or even just used as a collectible! We’ve worked and released songs with national and international famous Latin-American artists, and we’re looking to broaden our horizon by reaching out and inviting worldwide music celebrities to collaborate next. We believe that true innovation comes not only from creating great products, but creating a new mindset… That’s why for the first time ever we’re making it possible for non-musicians to be part of music creation, for big artists to collaborate and engage with their fans in a new way, and for investors to be part of the next generation of Music Backed Securities with which they’ll be able to, not only diversify their portfolios and periodically earn yields over long periods of time, but to be part of the creation of amazing music between artists and fans. Because we believe that, if a single mind has been able to create a masterpiece, imagine what we could create all together. "

Once their products are on the market, these companies will need to advertise them. Today, most publishers do not accept cryptocurrencies, primarily because the general demand from traditional companies is not significant enough to justify the adoption of a new type of payment. However, by 2018 the advertising market will be facing an influx of companies raising through ICO, and therefore most of them will have their budgets in cryptocurrencies. AB-CHAIN will provide companies that have raised money through ICO with an ad network where they can buy online advertising using multiple types of cryptocurrencies and without the need to convert them to fiat.

For too long, baby care and diapering has been approached the same way: the same old disposable diapers sold in stores, in pack sizes that don’t reflect usage. This model hasn’t been changed to reflect what today’s parents need : A convenient set-it-and-forget it approach to Baby Care that makes their busy lives easier; with high quality, design-oriented, earth-friendly products; and an opportunity for them to give to those in need with a purchase they are required to make.  Convenient.  You and your baby are at the core of our mission. We’re parents too; we know how busy life is and how little time you want to spend thinking about diapers. We’ve built the smartest, most flexible subscription model in the business. Our options enable you to choose the cadence that works for you, allows for multiple sizes within the same box, and enables a mix of our crowd-determined designs.  Conscientious.  We know how much your little one means to you, and that you want to make sure that any product touching their skin is gentle and effective (because blowouts happen!) We also understand how much you value the environment – you want it to be pristine for generations to come! For A&F, this means using the highest quality products that are gentler on the planet, with an eye for design.  Charitable.  Being a parent is one of the most universal experiences. We share many of the same hopes and dreams for our children – that they find their passion, experience gratitude and understand giving back. At A&F, we have built our business around giving back. Diaper need can have a huge impact in the lives of other parents and their ability to provide for their little ones, so A&F donates diapers to those in need for every purchase you make – because it’s never too early to start giving back"

Our properties are situated in the least seismic areas of Abruzzo region.  The agency is registered and regulated by the Chamber of Commerce of Chieti and we are members of F.I.M.A.A, this is the most reliable Italian association of brokers and real estate agents. The company is fully insured and this also includes insurance of our clients. Abruzzo Rural Property has been working for the past seven years helping foreign buyers find their dream homes in the Abruzzo and Molise regions. We have extensive knowledge and a true passion for these areas. We provide each client guidance and support through tailor-made services and property searches in an open and honest manner. Each client’s enquiry is dealt with on a personal basis, trying to establish precisely what is required in order to save energy and avoid loss of time and unnecessary expenses. Here below are some of the services we provide: DURING THE PROPERTY SEARCH: How we can guide and assist you before and whilst you are abroad searching for your dream property in Abruzzo.     - We have personally visited all of the properties listed; therefore we can provide all of the necessary details and information.    - If we know exactly what you are looking for, we can start a specific and personalised property search for you.    - An English speaking fully licensed real estate agent will reply to all of your questions before you travel to Abruzzo.    - We will arrange a property tour trying to make the most of your time in Abruzzo whilst being flexible to your needs and timeframes. PURCHASE PROCESS: When you have found your dream home and you are ready to buy we will cover all of the following tasks to ensure a smooth and safe purchase.    - Provision of all the documents necessary to buy in Italy    - Legal checks of the documents related to the chosen property    - Registration of the preliminary agreement    - English speaking Notary service    - Estimates of purchase costs    - English speaking surveyors to provide a survey in English (if required)    - Translation of purchase documents (if required) AFTER SALE SERVICES: After the purchase we will continue to help you by customising our services to your individual needs. The common requirements are:    - Utilities changeovers under new buyer’s name    - Contact with several local contractors, surveyors/architects to get restoration quotes and details if the house needs restoration works.    - Continual after sale services according to specific needs. OUR APPROACH TO RESTORATION AND TECHNICAL SURVEYS: Many of the properties listed on our website: www.abruzzoruralproperty.com, need restoration or renovation. Abruzzo Rural Property has a completely different approach to restoration projects. We do not have an in-house architect or surveyor as this would be a considered as a conflict of interest here in Italy.  When a client buys a house in need of restoration we can start working together with him to find the best estimates from local building companies. We compare prices, availability to complete the works on a given timeframe, skills, ability to understand the client, etc…There are many skilled builders in the Abruzzo and Molise regions, it is not necessary to limit yourself to just one building company either. We have the same approach with surveyors, architects, technical engineers; we always select local people and we tend to work with those who provide the best services and have great past track records.  Over the years, Abruzzo Rural Property has established trusted contacts with the most reliable professionals such as notaries, surveyors and contractors; we work with different companies in order to be able to always provide excellent services at the most cost effective prices. Every client is unique, each comes with their own individual needs, dreams, concerns or apprehensions. We endeavour to customise our services according to our client’s specific needs and personalities. "

Company has developed new paradigms & cutting edge timing signoff methodologies, which have allowed creating new statistical tools that are superior to commercially available STA/SSTA tools. The tools prevent timing violations in critical paths that lead to silicon failure & remove timing pessimism in the rest of paths. Abelite’s unique & truly statistical tools offer:  	- Modeling all conceivable global/local, random/correlated sources of variations including EDA tools/flow/libraries inaccuracies/errors, PVT & geometry variations in cells, wires/vias, Double Patterning Technology (DPT), Aging Degradation (AD), Layout Dependent Effects (LDE) & FinFET  	- Estimating timing yield & power consumption 	- Achieving timing signoff with needed confidence & with taking into account the number of timing critical paths, and  	- Performing optional signoff at all needed PVT/RC/Via/AD/DPT corners Abelite methodology prevents silicon failure while improving design performance, power & area, obtaining best QoR & reduces TAT, Costs & TTM. Methodology & tools were verified on multiple test-cases & designs for several technology nodes.  Business Value: All current designs are at risk of silicon failure due to drawbacks in conventional EDA tools & methodologies that may overlook violations in few paths with “untypical” structures & properties. At the same time, most companies use too many PVT/RC/Via corners & these corners (libraries) are pessimistically characterized for most logical & clock stages. On top, unjustified & often conservative timing derates are used along with OCV/AOCV/POCV/LOCV/SOCV timing derating methods in STA tools, which are not accurate & have multiple drawbacks. It results in risk of silicon failure in few paths & overdesigning & over-margining the majority of paths.  Abelite provides new advanced tools, which are complimentary to current commercial STA/SSTA tools. Abelite will provide best-in-industry consulting in all areas of timing signoff, work with customers to specify their needs, limitations & goals. Customers decide what additional characterization of technology, designs & EDA tools they will do, what data they will share & what services they require. Abelite will provide answers to all customers’ requests including support on conventional timing derating like AOCV/POCV/LOCV. Customers are not required to change their EDA tools (it may be PrimeTime or Encounter Timing Analyzer/Tempus) & design flows.
