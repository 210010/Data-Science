Yesware’s Reports and Analytics give salespeople unprecedented feedback about how their messages are being received.  This is not new technology. They are focused on optimizing proven technology to meet the needs of power users - people who get and send 100 or more emails a day, people who want computers to take on more data-entry and more automation, so that users can focus on building relationships and closing more business. The company's initial target market for B2B salespeople. For these people, a productivity tool that can help them reach their sales goals is extremely valuable. Yesware offers 100 free tracking emails per month to start and you can earn up to 100 additional emails for referring friends, or upgrade to a Plus account with unlimited email tracking. The company also offers Team, Enterprise, and Custom product plans. Learn more at www.yesware.com/plans-and-pricing.  Sales managers who deploy Yesware to their teams see activity-based reports that reveal a new level of performance detail without relying on additional data entry. Yesware’s collaboration features enable salespeople and sales managers to share the most effective templates with their colleagues.  The market for Yesware is huge, and so is the competition. Companies like Salesforce, Microsoft and Oracle sell billions of dollars of enterprise software annually to corporate IT departments. Their software, however, is almost exclusively aimed at sales management and oversight instead of helping salespeople sell more. Yesware sells its services directly to salespeople, and has to prove its worth to them, instead of to an IT or marketing department interested in sales pipeline visibility."

If you regularly need backup power and have roof space, YouSolar can provide a complete energy solution at much lower cost than electricity from a diesel generator. You will have reliable, high quality electricity with no switchover during grid outages and plenty of power when turning on appliances. Best of all, they will monitor your system 24/7 and back it up with a 5-year warranty. The worldwide market for solar systems is poised to grow exponentially. India is the hotspot. In July 2015 India announced a goal of 40 GW of power from rooftop solar by 2022 (equivalent to 10 million systems). However, two big challenges must be overcome: How to integrate these systems with the grid, and how to finance them. YouSolar’s solar+battery systems and secure leasing model are the answers. Thanks to this proprietary intelligence, the YouSolar system uses nearly all the solar energy generated by the solar array and, thus, does not have to be “net metered”. The system takes power from the grid, but never sends power to the grid. So, there is no need to get a permit from the utility. YouSolar’s system can remain functioning at all times, unlike net metered systems which must shut down during power cuts (for safety). Being available during power cuts and requiring no permits are big advantages in markets like India."

Long duration dialogues are conversations and audio content ranging from 5 seconds to several hours. Yap specializes in accurately transcribing these dialogues for a variety of different scenarios including voicemail-to-text, conference call transcriptions, analysis of customer phone calls and voice-activated mobile messaging. The company was a TechCrunch finalist in 2007. Their management team previously worked on Apple's iPod, Honda's navigational systems, IBM's ViaVoice, Microsoft's Tellme speech division and Nuance's Dragon products. Yap white labels its SaaS platform -- i.e., Yap Speech Cloud(TM) -- to enable diverse use cases, including messaging, call analytics and voicemail-to-text. For example, Microsoft uses Yap for voice-based mobile messaging applications. Their end users can say anything they want to and have Yap's platform transcribe it into text (far more convenient than typing on the fumbling with a devices keypad while driving). MetroPCS also is a Yap customer. Cincinnati Bell, a regional carrier, uses Yap-based technology to convert subscriber voicemails into text. The carrier was a competitive win away from SpinVox (now Nuance). Part of the allure for Yap's service is that it's completely automated. That means there is no need for humans listening to messages, typing them out, and then sending them back out, giving Yap a real advantage in ensuring privacy. Because Yap is completely machine powered, the company is able to offer lower costs, higher speeds and greater consistency."

So my name is Yaroslav Merkulov. On June 7th, 2015 I will begin my professional golf career playing on the SwingThought.com Tour and the eGolf Tour. I played collegiate golf as a member of the Duke University varsity men's golf team. However, I spent a year away from golf pursuing other opportunities in life. I went back to Duke to get my Master's in Management Studies through the Fuqua school of Business. However, over the course of the past year i began to realize that my heart and passion is with Golf. Upon graduation, i had several job offers and i subsequently turned them down to pursue competitive professional golf. At one point in my career I was considered one of the best up and coming golfers in the United States. I had a rather lackluster collegiate career, however my desire and drive for golf has been reborn.   I already have a deal with Titleist as part of their postgraduate players sponsorship. this sponsorship requires i compete in 20 professional events per year for a two year period. This leaves me with needing some funds to cover entry fees and some living expenses. In order to comply with Titleist's requests, I need to raise $50,000. I have already estimated all foreseeable costs and this dollar amount will allow me to comfortably pursue my career.   Furthermore, as long as the donations are not anonymous, I will be offering to payback 10% of my winnings per share as a dividend."

Whether you are trying to share your new address with a long lost friend you met at the market, or a funny YouTube video with an audience of thousands, you can do so simply and verbally by telling them the Yumber. So what is a Yumber? A Yumber is a word or phrase that redirects the user to a specific target. A target can be a URL, phone number, physical address, email address, file, collection of files, photos, etc. virtually anything you want to share can be tied to a Yumber and then shared verbally face to face, over the radio, on the tv, or from a stage to thousands of people.  Try it yourself, goto Yumber.com and enter the Yumber:  One man band  You will find yourself watching a YouTube video located at a complicated YouTube URL without requiring you to speak the computer language necessary to read that lengthy YouTube address:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXMuWi0dUBc  So what is a Yumber? It is natural, it is the marriage of word of mouth and technology, it is the way you learned to speak from birth, which technology, until now, has attempted to train out of you. With Yumber.com you can share anything with anyone anywhere using a simple word or phrase that you created for that purpose.  Why tell someone I will email you the link later, Or I will email you the file later, when you can simply tell them the associated Yumber to the target now and allow them to look it up at their convenience? The Internet was created by techies for techies. However, even these techies realized the need to evolve the Internet when the number of sites grew to the point at which it become difficult to remember all of the IP addresses of the new sites.  In its infancy the Internet was navigates by using IP addresses such as 192.168.0.1. To simplify navigation the a second layer was created, which is the domain name based system we still use today. This domain name system, complete with https, .coms, and /'s alike, is still on the level with the old and unintuitive MS DOS command prompt.  Just as Apple evolved the computer with its intuitive and human friendly operating system, Yumber is seeking to evolve the sharing of technology by adding another layer of simplicity that is more intuitive than the last. Instead of humans having to conform with the confines of computer language as defined by technology, Yumber adds a layer of humanity to technology allowing people to share themselves and their interests verbally in face to face settings.  Whether one on one, or while presenting to large audiences, Yumber helps you to put the power back in word of mouth communication."

Yardarm has developed the most sophisticated approach to firearm event tracking and awareness available in the market. The Yardarm Sensor recognizes geo-location, movement, holstering and un-holstering, the discharge of a firearm, as well as direction of fire. These events are transmitted in real-time to the Yardarm Servers (Cloud), where the data can be delivered to Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) centers or Real-Time Crime Center (RTCC) dashboards, allowing command to use this information to support officers in the field.  Custom rule-sets and provisioning tools allow commanders to establish use models that match the needs for their departments and officers. This flexibility enables a wide range of use-cases that can be applied to the sidearm an officer carries or tactical weapons used by SWAT and the military. The company’s patent pending technology delivers new levels of awareness for any organization that utilizes and manages firearms.

That takes away your focus and valuable time, that you should use to focus on what really matters: You creativity and developing skills. Instead of having a hosting plan on a complex and expensive server, having to configure FTP and DB from scratch, and remembering all the different login credentials for each of your clients, you can just upload your files to your Dropbox and that's it. You will have your website up and running using only one platform, hassle-free."

Running into financial difficulties, Kumarov sold the paper to Yehuda Mozes, a wealthy land dealer who regarded the paper as an interesting hobby and a long-term financial investment. His sons, Reuben and Noah ran the paper with Noah as the first managing editor. In 1948, a large group of journalists and staff members led by chief editor Ezriel Carlebach left to form Yedioth Maariv, later known as Maariv. Carlebach was replaced by Herzl Rosenblum.
