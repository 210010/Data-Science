Current security controls are being undermined. Compromised SSL/TLS, SSH and mobile certificates and keys undermine data loss prevention, next-gen firewalls, strong authentication, sandboxing and other security systems. Attackers 1) mask their true identity using keys and certificates and 2) hide their actions by encrypting data which means you can’t look inside for threats.

Verato uses this database as an answer key during matching to make matches no other approach can ever make—even if two records have out-of-date, errored, incomplete, and inconsistent identity data.  Because of this approach, our match rates are the highest in the industry.  We deliver sub-second performance and can securely handle hundreds of millions of transactions to support the largest organizations.  Since, Verato is cloud-based, there is no software to deploy, support, and maintain.  We deliver quick time-to-value (weeks, not months or years) and a lower total cost of ownership than any of the on-premises solutions being used today. Better, cheaper, faster."

Veniti,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/veniti,"Biotechnology, Medical, Medical Device","VENITI is the first medical device company developing a suite of innovative technology and solutions that will provide comprehensive treatment across the venous disease continuum. Venous disease refers to all conditions related to or caused by veins that become diseased or abnormal. This encompasses a broad set of maladies. The venous disease cycle begins when vein walls become weak or damaged, or the valves are stretched or injured, and can no longer prevent reflux (backward flow of blood). Once the veins lose their ability to convey blood without reflux, the progressive venous disease cycle has begun. This is commonly referred to as chronic venous insufficiency, or CVI. The blood will begin to back up into the peripheral veins, causing venous hypertension, potential thrombosis (clotting), and leading to even more damage of the vein walls and valves. This in turn leads to more reflux. The VENITI team of experts in science, technology and business are currently developing the VENITI VICI VENOUS STENT® System. Through this, and other, innovative technology, VENITI will achieve results that sets it apart in addressing the challenges specific to the venous system and venous disease."

The company's patent-pending, bladder-specific cryotherapy technology eliminates costly and problematic repeat surgeries seen with TURBT, reducing the need for hospital stay by providing in office or ambulatory treatment. The technology successfully ablates unwanted tissue, reduces the risk of dispersed cancers cells, all while causing no bladder damage. The Vessi system consists of a standalone console and a disposable catheter that is inserted into the bladder.  Vessi is backed by the Trendlines Group, a leading Israeli early stage investor, and led by seasoned medical device and cryotherapy veterans.

VesselVanguard,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/vesselvanguard,"Manufacturing, Marine Transportation, Water","VesselVanguard was conceived and created by Don Hyde, an experienced sailor and technology entrepreneur. As the owner of an Island Packet 485, Don experienced the frustrations of assimilating the full range of details found in 35 pounds of manuals in order to maintain his boat at the peak of performance and functionality. The design for this simple yet innovative service results from exhaustive interviews with owners, manufacturers, dealers, brokers and service personnel. The increasing complexity and sophistication of today's boats requires greater adherence to the manufacturer's suggested maintenance schedules. VesselVanguard makes this entire process simple and assures optimum performance both on the water and at the dock. Their mission is to fill in the knowledge gap so that boaters approach each on-water experience with confidence and control. VesselVanguard enables the boat-owner to enhance their stewardship of the boat while also preserving its value.  The systems designed into a boat by an imaginative boat maker, and choices later made by an owner, are intended to function together to create a safe and comfortable on-board environment. VesselVanguard understands this and its purpose is to decrease the complexity of understanding and maintaining all these systems. This level of acute care delivers the most important and indefinable reality to the boat-owner: Peace of Mind and More Time on the Water."

Veristream,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/veristream,"Information Technology, Security, Software","The founders of Veristream pioneered audio detection and verification technology for use in electronic security, as well as the first web based visitor management system.

In addition to audio technologies, our founders developed the first central station managed access control system to be integrated into a security system and remotely managed and monitored. Veristream's sister organization, Advantor Systems LLC, was formed in the early ‘90s to leverage these technologies for high security applications in the US Military. Today, Advantor is one of the leading providers of electronic security to the US Military on the GSA Schedule. Through this military experience, our security technologies expanded into the online world with creation of the first, fully web based visitor management system: iVisitor. For more than a decade, iVisitor has been the leading lobby technology in helping secure buildings from external threats by adopting and implementing new visitor management processes. It was initially developed for automation and scale to eliminate paper based do-not-admit lists and manual arrival notification processes.  However, immediately following the terrorist attacks of 9/11, we received a high demand for iVisitor from high profile office buildings and fortune 100 clients.  As a result, iVisitor expanded to service this sector, and Veristream was formed. Our goal is to combine the unique value of our two businesses: Advantor and Veristream.  Together, they bring a consolidated web-based solution to the commercial market for electronic security, access control, CCTV, and visitor management."

Venture Giant,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/venture-giant,"Finance, FinTech","The two problems facing entrepreneurs in the UK seeking to raise investment funding for their business Venture or Startups currently are: 1) Entrepreneurs are only really allowed to send their business plan and investment pitch to investors that have ""self-certified themselves as high net worth individuals or sophisticated investors"". Current strict regulations prevent entrepreneurs and small business owners on sending their business plan or investment pitch to “Regular Joe Public”.  2) The other problem facing entrepreneurs seeking to raise investment for their business venture are on how to locate and pitch to these elusive investors in the UK without revealing too much information on the business idea especially when valuable IP (intellectual property) is involved. Venture Giant is an online Angel Investor platform that was created to solve these exact problems and bridge the gap between both Worlds. Not only does Venture Giant solve the immediate problem on how to locate these self-certified high net worth individuals and angel investors but also solves the problem on how to present an investment proposal to them without revealing too much sensitive information on the business idea itself. All entrepreneurs and small businesses that are seeking to raise investment from private investors for their business ventures are able to use the investment platform, and private investors can browse these proposals in a friendly - easy to use environment. The difference between a Crowd Funding Site and an online Angel Investment platform like Venture Giant is that investment ranges of £20,000 to £500,000 can be raised from through a syndicate of 1 - 5 individual investors as opposed to raising funds through hundreds of single individuals through Crowd funding websites. Some businesses do benefit from funding from the crowd, whereas other entrepreneurs choose to not reveal their valuable IP in such a public format as a crowd funding site. Investment proposals featured by Venture Giant can only be viewed by high net worth individuals and sophisticated investors that have signed self-certification agreements, and are eligible to legally browse these investment deals posted from entrepreneurs for all funding amounts and regions in the UK. Notably, Venture Giant does not feature full business plans, but opts to feature one pager, taster investment summaries to find investor interest. Venture Giant also sends out these deals to investors as filtered deal flow and takes a more active approach in promoting each investment proposal. The total combined pool of Angel investment available from UK Investors on the platform currently stand at over£3bn and grows daily as more investors self-certify themselves to use the online investment platform. Venture Giant has recently been nominated ""Best investment network award"" by Angel Investor News and has been reviewed extensively in the Press including articles featured in the Sunday Telegraph, and have raised over £2.2m for start-ups and property deals, commission free. They are currently not FCA regulated which means that they are not a commission collecting service. This works best when an entrepreneur needs the freedom of negotiating the best terms on what works best for their business.

Velcon Filters,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/velcon-filters,Industrial,"Originally named Enfab, Inc., Velcon Filters, LLC was founded in 1953 byHarold Higbee, a Tooling Engineer, and L.W. (Lu) Taylor, an Industrial Engineer. Both had extensive experience in the fiberglass industry. The first products were fabricated fiberglass components for the 2.75 Rocket sold to the United States government. Imaginative R&D led to the creation of a proprietary fiberglass filter coalescer in 1957. This revolutionary product was initially introduced to both military and commercial aviation fuel markets and subsequently to pipelines and refineries. Velcon now supplies more replacement cartridges to purify jet fuel than any other company in the world. In 1979, Velcon introduced to the market its patented Aquacon® water-absorbing cartridges which remove water and dirt from industrial oils and fuels, restoring the oil or fuel to a clean, usable condition. The outer layers of filter media remove particulate contaminants, while the inner layers chemicallyretain water within the super-absorbent media. As the cartridge reaches its absorption capacity, the media expands rapidly to restrict the flow of unfiltered oil or fuel, signaling the operator to replace the cartridge. In 1991, Lu Taylor became Chairman of the Board and his son David C. Taylor assumed the position of President. Dave Taylor brought with him a broad range of technical and management experience. Velcon’s commitment to quality has been recognized through its achievement of the ISO 9001 Certification of Registration in 2000. Most recently Velcon has requalified for ISO 9001, proving its continuing achievement of quality standards. Velcon is also the first filter manufacturer to receive qualifications for all three categories of the EI 1581 5th Edition Specification. In April 2009, Velcon Filters, LLC was acquired by Sterling Group, LP, a private equity investment firm that targets controlling interests in basic manufacturing, industrial services and distribution companies. The Taylor family and members of management continue in their roles as substantial shareholders in Velcon in partnership with Sterling. “The Velcon team believes this partnership will provide significant opportunities to further develop and expand the company’s reach,” said David Taylor, who remains CEO of Velcon. In November, 2009, Velcon acquired Chemflo, a process filtration company, creating “Velcon Process,” a division of Velcon Filters, LLC. Chemflo was founded in 1998. Velcon Process works as partners with petrochemical producers, refineries, transmission companies, gas plants, food and beverage producers and other process industries to improve their overall process as it relates to filtration and separation. In 2010, in an ongoing effort to ensure quality products, Velcon constructed a diesel fuel test lab at its Colorado facility. Now Velcon is poised to verify the effectiveness of its filtration products for the rapidly expanding diesel and biodiesel market."
