QurAlis,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/quralis,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Therapeutics","QurAlis is specifically focused on discovering and developing new therapies for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common form of motor neuron disease and the genetically similar disease, Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord, leading to paralysis and an inability to speak and breath, with an average life expectancy of only 3 years from diagnosis and an age of onset averaging at 55. Recent advances in DNA sequencing of patients show that ALS can be caused by mutations in close to 30 different genes which cause multiple different sub-forms of the disease. It is therefore unlikely that all ALS patients can be treated the same way. Mutations in some of these genes also cause FTD, and thus these two diseases may be treated by similar therapies. The QurAlis strategy is to go for ALS one gene at a time. We do this by using a transformative system in which cells from ALS patients are used to model the disease in a dish to identify new drugs. Two of the founders of QurAlis, Harvard professors Kevin Eggan and Clifford Woolf have pioneered this technology for ALS resulting in the discovery of a potential new ALS drug, Ezogabine, which is being tested in a phase 2 clinical trial. QurAlis is a Cambridge based subsidiary company of Q-State Biosciences, a stem cell biotechnology company that has developed proprietary technologies for which QurAlis has the exclusive rights for use in ALS drug discovery."

CoRE™ applies cutting edge machine learning techniques from three complementary informatics technologies: Supervised Learning, Transfer Learning and Active Learning, to efficiently solve multi-parameter optimization problems in a series of discrete discovery cycles.  CoRE’s unique capability to effect simultaneous co-optimization of the entire efficacy, safety and off-target effects property profile is vastly more efficient than the standard approach and greatly accelerates discovery. Based on over 20 industry collaborations, it is very realistic to expect, at a minimum, CoRE™ can reduce preclinical attrition 5%, preclinical costs 20% and lead optimization costs 40%. When these three parameters were adjusted in a recent assessment of pharmaceutical R&D productivity (Paul et al. 2010 ) to capture the effects of using CoRE™, this translated to capitalized costs savings of $238 million and out-of-pocket cost reductions of $88 million.  Additionally, CoRE™ can quickly yield significant reductions in time which may be instrumental in gaining first mover IP advantage, particularly with novel targets. The Revolutionary CoRE™ Platform Changes How Predictive In Silico Models Are Generated and Deployed, and How Highly Accurate Predictive Models Enable and Accelerate Efficient Drug Discovery.

quay.io,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/quay-io,Software,"Quay.io was originally created out of necessity when the company wanted to use Docker containers with an original IDE product. Docker containers were being used to host and isolate server processes invoked on behalf of our users and often running their code. The project was started by building the Docker image dynamically whenever a new host node spun up. The image was monolithic. It was too large, took too long to build, and was hard to manage conflicts. It was everything that Docker wasn't supposed to be. When it was decided to split it up into pre-built images and host them somewhere, it was noticed that there wasn't a good place to host images securely. Determined to scratch the itch, Quay.io was built, and officially launched it as an aside in a presentation to the Docker New York City Meetup on October 2nd, 2013. After launch, customers demanded that Quay.io become the main focus. They rely on the company to make sure they can store and distribute their Docker images. In August, 2014, Quay.io joined CoreOS to provide registry support for the enterprise."

Yet, surprisingly, it is often overlooked by top executives. Quite simply, communications services have become mission critical. Voice, data, cellular, local, long distance, Internet access, DSL, VPN, calling cards, PBX, voice mail, unified messaging, network management, broadband access – these services are the lifeblood of any enterprise that wants to tackle global markets, innovate at Internet speed, and engage in the continuous transformation that is demanded by today's competitive environment. Unfortunately, the process of procuring and managing them has become increasingly chaotic and costly. Communications has become the third largest operational expense in mid-size companies. Even at that expense, much of it remains hidden, scattered throughout the enterprise, distributed among the business units, duplicated by mergers and acquisitions. Communications managers find themselves inundated with a mind-numbing array of service options, overwhelmed with literally boxes of bills, and continually asking for more headcount. Managing these multiple vendors diverts critical resources away from core business initiatives. Billing errors reduce funding for research, product development, marketing, and sales. Outages and downtime undermine relationships with customers and partners. With so much at stake, a comprehensive, single-source solution is needed for procuring and managing communications services."

From its early beginnings, Quidgest dedicated its resources towards the Public Administration modernization, with large research investments for this sector. The high number of clients' requests and the lack of technicians in the early 90's led Quidgest to create Genio, a highly productive software development platform that has been daily used since 1991 for the production of all information systems. Between 1989 and 1995, Quidgest centred its activity on clients' specific requirements and developed an integrated information system for Public Administration combining Human Resources, Finance & Accounting, Assets Management and Document Management, along with more specific solutions. Using Genio, the company's highly productive software development platform, Quidgest developed a high capacity of introducing new specification requirements in its software solutions and quickly became a strong reference as a custom-built software supplier. Between 1996 and 1998, Quidgest migrated all its software solutions to Microsoft Visual C++. In 2005, Quidgest added C# and Java languages to its auto-generated code, being able to produce multi-programming language solutions. All information systems produced by Quidgest from the year 2000 were available in MSDB Microsoft SQL Server and were adapted a year later for Oracle and IBM DB2. Quidgest became a Microsoft Certified Solution Provider in 1999, as well as a Microsoft Certified Partner in 2001; Microsoft ISV/Software Solutions (Information Software Vendor), Microsoft NIS (Networking Infrastructure Solutions) and Microsoft Gold Certified Partner in 2005. Also a certified training entity, with recognized Leader SME, Quidgest joined COTECâ€:tm:s innovative SMEs network in 2006.
