Jersey Mike's Subs,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/jersey-mike-s-subs,Food Processing,"It started back in 1956, in this actual storefront location and was originally called Mike's Subs. Mike opened the small shop in the sea-side town of Point Pleasant, New Jersey. You have to remember that in 1956, there were very few franchise restaurants or hamburger chains. No chain pizza, chicken or taco restaurants, either. In 1956, proprietors of mom-and-pop businesses would open their stores in basic storefront locations like you see here. To survive and thrive, they had to offer exceptional quality products, coupled with unparalleled service. In 1956, Mike was unique in that the product he was offering was a relatively new item in American society – the submarine sandwich. Mike also benefited from the geographic location of his store. Point Pleasant, New Jersey is centrally located in the state on the legendary Jersey Shore. It is approximately 1 hour south of New York City, 1 hour east of Philadelphia, and about 3 hours north of Maryland, Delaware and Washington, D.C. For over a century, the people that lived and worked in these metropolitan areas would flock to Point Pleasant to experience the sun, surf, sand, boardwalk, salt water taffy, and all the treasures that made up the legendary Jersey Shore experience. Mike capitalized on the influx of vacationers, visitors and local residents by offering them his unique new product – submarine sandwiches. But what really differentiated his restaurant was the experience he gave his customers. Recognizing them by name, and knowing the sandwich they were going to order, because of their frequent visits. People would line up throughout the summer to buy the sub sandwiches that Mike was selling, and to enjoy the experience of coming into his shop. For over half a decade, he built the business into a thriving landmark, and was a pioneer of the authentic subs sandwich. In 1972, Peter Cancro was a high school student in Point Pleasant, New Jersey. He began working at Mike's Subs at the age of 14. Peter loved working at Mike's. He loved authentic submarine sandwiches. But even more, Peter loved working behind the counter, interacting and talking with the customers. He liked learning about where they were from and their summer vacation experiences. He took pride in knowing which authentic sub sandwich his loyal customer would order as they entered the store. When Peter was a senior in high school, he overheard the owner of Mike's Subs discussing selling the business. He thought to himself, ""I love the food, I love working in the store, maybe I'll buy the shop."" Pretty ambitious for a 17 year old kid. Peter approached his football coach and said ""Hey coach, Mike's Sub shop is for sale, and I'm interested in buying it. Can you help me out?"" It didn't hurt that his football coach was also a banker.  The football coach came through for Peter, and backed his loan. So, at the tender age of 17 – before he was legally able to slice a sub – Peter Cancro became the owner and proprietor of Mike's Subs. Shortly after buying Mike's, he married his wife Linda, and they opened a couple more local outlets of Mike's Subs. Peter expanded upon the phenomenon of Mike's Subs. Teaching the crew to interact and talk with the customer, to share a passion for getting to know the customer. He spent the next decade building on the cult-like following that Mike's Subs already enjoyed. They would have customers lined up out the door in the summertime waiting to get the authentic sub sandwiches that Mike's was famous for. In the mid-eighties, Peter heard more and more people say, ""Peter, we're going to miss you and your subs this winter. We sure wish you would put a Mike's where we live!"" People would come in at the end of the summer and get several giant subs wrapped for travel, to carry back to their homes across the country. This got Peter thinking, and he started researching the possibilities of franchising the Mike's concept. In 1987, Peter began franchising. He changed the name from Mike's Subs to Jersey Mike's Subs to capture the authenticity of where the authentic sub sandwich was born. Today, Peter Cancro is CEO of Jersey Mike's Franchise Systems Inc., overseeing more than 1,500 locations open and under development. Despite the title, Peter still jumps behind the counter to test his skills and demonstrate his passion for the product and the customer. He tries to instill that passion in every store he enters and with every franchisee he meets. Today, the authentic taste – served Mike's Way® with lettuce, onions, tomatoes, oil, vinegar and spices – is available nationwide. Our secret? Everything about Jersey Mike’s is high quality. Our certified Angus Beef top rounds are trimmed and cooked right in the store. Our meats and cheeses are all top-quality premium brands. Our bread is fresh-baked each day on the premises. And of course, everything’s prepared right in front of you. It’s what makes Jersey Mike’s the most authentic tasting submarine sandwich available. And it’s a tradition of quality we’ll never outgrow."

Then realizing that customers may likely still require transport while their own aircraft are being maintained, he also began offering aircraft charter and management services to European and Middle Eastern customers. During the 1970s, Jet Aviation started opening facilities abroad, beginning with a maintenance facility in Germany and an FBO in Jeddah. In 1977, it began offering completions and refurbishment services at Basel, completing its first ever V.I.P.-outfitted aircraft – a Convair 880M — that same year. Today, Jet Aviation Basel is one of the largest independent completions center in the world. Continuing its expansion in Europe and the Middle East throughout the 1980s, Jet Aviation also successfully entered the U.S. market, making it the first global player in the business aviation industry. Consolidation and steady growth marked the 1990s, with the opening of a maintenance and FBO facility in Singapore in 1995 and an aircraft management and charter firm in Hong Kong, China in 2000. As pioneers of private business aviation, the Hirschman family built Jet Aviation up over nearly 40 years from a small local maintenance operation to a highly reputed global business aviation services provider, before deciding to sell the family-run business to Permira Funds, a private European equity firm, in 2005.

And yet, sometimes the sea can get quite rough, or you are not at the top of your game or you are not too good at it yet. In these cases, it is impossible to ride a wave because we cannot get through two critical moments in order to get to that point: paddling out past the breakers and paddling to catch the wave and take off. Sometimes it is so hard that surfers end up exhausting themselves very quickly and having to come out of the water. This is precisely what Jetson is there for: to help surfers paddle out past the breakers and, even more, to provide an additional boost at takeoff. This way, you can take off sooner, right on time for the wave pick you up and carry you forward while you enjoy riding out on its shoulder.

The shapes built by a master like Marcos Slash are fine-tuned to the smallest detail, guaranteeing the board's moves will be both dynamic and ""surf-worthy"". With Jetson, you can push your limits and surf on rough days or with bigger waves, but counting on the safety margin that comes from being able to catch the waves before they break. Jetson technology's exclusive goal is to improve your surfing experience. At Jetson, technology is not an end in itself, but a great effort has been made in terms of development and technology so that, when you surf with our boards, you will only feel the comfort and reliability they offer. Every detail, every piece has been designed with a view to maximizing the surfing experience: autonomy, size, jet geometry, weight, boost, power, operating controls, automatisms... We have spent years testing several prototypes until we reached the levels of comfort and reliability we are able to offer today.

Jevelo, on the contrary, has a story that doesn’t have to explain itself. Jevelo is not merely jewelry. It is you. Tell your story. Design with your phone, they manufacture it! Manufacturing of Jevelo jewelry pieces takes place in Fiskars village located in Southern Finland, which has been a center of handcraft and metal manufacturing since 1649. By combining latest technology and the arts of traditional goldsmith techniques, they bring together the best of both worlds.

Jenlogix Ltd,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/jenlogix-ltd,"Consulting, Information Technology, Manufacturing, Software","JENLOGIX has its roots in an electronic design consultancy. Founded by Grant Keymer in 1984 and growing from humble beginnings in a basement, the company initially concentrated on software development for a data logging system.  This evolved over almost ten years to eventually include graphical mimic diagrams, remote modem connections and multi-user access. Various hardware design projects were also undertaken to support the data logging system, these included single-board computers and remote data acquisition modules.  Designed well before the advent of modern half-size PC-compatible SBCs and ADAM modules, these were forerunners to the products we have today. The underlying principles of robust design and flexible configuration however are the same, giving us an in-depth product knowledge and the ability to support hardware and software design engineers from our own long experience. In early 1986 the company began to import IBM-compatible PCs, initially for use in automation projects, but later expanding to the point where it became a separate business in its own right. The consulting and PC importing areas of the company continued to develop in parallel, with both areas complementing each other, resulting in our being able to offer customers the benefit of our own experience in applications of PCs, not just a ""box-mover"" approach.  From 1990, the consulting area of the company changed focus from R&D, to utilisation of our standard products that had been developed over the years. Additional staff  were employed to work on factory automation projects including batching systems, production monitoring & recording systems, and weigh-labelling systems. From these projects we gained further appreciation of the difficulties faced by System Integrators when dealing with local distributors offering inadequate technical support.  The recession of 1991-92 brought with it a rationalisation of activities, resulting in a more focussed approach in the most successful areas. These proved to be the Importing & Assembly of Industrial Computer and Barcode equipment, and our own manufacturing of standard products such as RS-232 to RS-422/485 converters and Serial Interface LCD displays.  In 2008 Grant Keymer sold JENLOGIX, and is now focusing on a new venture. This was during the global financial crisis (GFC) and meant a drop in demand from industry. There have been a couple of other owners who have taken control during this time. The company continued to focus on the sales and distribution of industrial computers and components building up strong relationships with mainly Taiwanese manufactures. Changes in staff have resulted in enabling  the company to return to the revenue levels found prior to the GFC."

But when you have a twitter account with more than 200 followers you miss all the best tweets they do, or you must take the time and read everything. We had this problem and started jealo.us. We hope finally everyone post their new bought shoes, dresses, cars, vacation trips, moments, etc. @jealous. If you login, you can see everything your twitter friends posted @jealous, so you can decide you are indeed ""jealous"" or you think the post is ""boring"". You can also leave a comment. We just launched the website and we're still working on it. If users use the # we save the location. If you select ""spots & brands"" in the menu (not yet implemented) users can see the most popular locations or brands. Also we show the user how much they spent there and at what location (if there is a value in the post, like $59). We are still busy with the spots & brands. This is a large item. Here we try to get the user a lot of information. Example tweet, ""I finally have my new IPhone 4 $99,- #macstore @jealous"" we know it's bought in a macstore and if there is a GPS location we know which macstore it is and that the price at this macstore is 99 dollars. (if the price is entered in euros the system automatically recalculates the value to dollars). In the spots & brands we show this post with the apple logo, a short description of the brand apple, all other post from user who used #macstore (or similar, like apple) and a total spent of all jealous users. Here you get a clear view of all users who bought an apple product, where and what they paid."
