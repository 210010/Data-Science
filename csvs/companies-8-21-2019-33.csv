Heliad Equity Partners,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/heliad-equity-partners,"E-Commerce, FinTech, Internet, Life Science, Media and Entertainment","telegram: https://t.me/HeliadEP Investment Focus Focus on Germany We focus on our home market, Germany, by drawing on the excellent network and exceptional deal flow available to us there. Moreover, Germany’s economy is by far the strongest and healthiest in Europe, and, in our opinion, will continue to remain so due to its numerous structural advantages: a vigorous SME landscape, (excessively) low interest rates given the economic upswing as well as the (excessively) low valuation of the euro, which encourages exports. The backbone of the German economy is made up not just of the well-known blue-chip companies traded on the DAX, but it is above all built on the country’s many listed and unlisted “second-tier” small- and medium-sized enterprises. And some of these SMEs have long since ceased to be the traditional family-owned-and-operated businesses of days gone by. Germany is currently undergoing a true start-up boom, and many German technology companies are not only able to hold their own against the competition from Silicon Valley and London – they are actually able to outperform them. Focus on 4 Sectors Over the years we have developed an explicit focus on the following four sectors: 1. Internet & Tech  2. e-commerce  3. Life Sciences  4. Media & Enter­tain­ment Heliad invests in both listed and unlisted companies in these sectors.  Investment Strategy Special Situations Our goal is to achieve long-term, above-average returns for our shareholders, which we have clearly succeeded in doing every single year since we introduced our new investment strategy in October 2012. In our opinion, this is only possible if one is willing to strike out in new directions and go the extra mile. Globally, and particularly in Germany, an excessive amount of capital is available primarily for “standard deals” (buyouts, venture capital, etc.), which causes valuations to rise and, as a result, returns to fall. By contrast, Heliad focuses on Special Situations during a company’s life cycle. For Special Situations special know-how and, above, all, active hands-on management are required. We do not participate in conventional M&A bids or invest in a company whose valuation is largely speculative. The following are good examples of potential Special Situations, though the list should not be considered complete since the challenge of Special Situations is precisely that each one represents a “special” and unique investment opportunity:     Restructurings/Turn Arounds:      These involve companies that possess a sound core, i.e. a good product, but that are confronted with structural problems – for example poor management, poor liquidity, slow sales, or a combination of issues.     Disruptive business ideas lacking the required entrepreneurial „kick“:      These are companies with ideas and business models innovative enough to revolutionize a sector, but whose management teams – perhaps because it’s their first time creating a company – need an investor/partner that can bring its network and experience to bear so that the company can quickly and fully reach its market potential.      Buy and Build, Role Up/Industry Consolidation & Platform Models:     Many companies do not make sense as stand-alone investments, or are simply too small for institutional investors. However, by bundling them into a larger structure that is able to generate synergies, they can become very attractive investments. Our principle focus is on providing equity, but, depending on the situation, we can also offer loans or mezzanine financing. Strong operative Management Team as guarantee for success We are entrepreneurs ourselves and as such firmly believe that outstanding, entrepreneurial management is the key to success. A company’s management is therefore by far the most important criterion when we are deciding whether or not to make an investment. The companies we invest in either already have an excellent team of founders and/or managers, or we are able – perhaps in the course of a restructuring – to replace the existing management team with managers we’re familiar with.     Subsequent to our investment, we work hand-in-hand with management and apply our extensive network and experience to quickly take the company to new heights. As part of standard corporate governance, we also actively exercise our shareholder rights as advisory council and/or supervisory board members.  Active Value Creation It is of high importance to invest under particularly favorable terms. Equally important, however, is to ask what needs to be done to resolve the problems outlined above so as to significantly increase the value of the company as quickly as possible. What is the catalyst that will allow the investment to take off? And will it then be in a position so that it can be sold at a profit? On the one side the old adage applies: “The profit lies in the purchase.” But profits can only be reaped at the time of sale. So thinking already at the time of investment about the divestment strategy makes a lot of sense. And in this the interests of Heliad shareholders and Heliad management are in perfect alignment, because the 20% profit participation for Heliad management only applies to actual, realized profits. Since catalysts are as varied as the investments themselves, the following list contains only a few examples. The critical factor, however, is not to wait until the situation improves but rather to proactively take the steps necessary to improve the situation:     Enlargement or replacement of the management team     IPO – a change in perspective:      We invest in both listed and unlisted companies but are above all interested in arbitrage effects that can be realized by taking private companies public.     Achieving ""critical mass"":     Many companies only become attractive to follow-on investors once they have achieved a critical mass in terms of revenues and profits. An active growth strategy, perhaps combined with an add-on acquisition strategy, offers a company wholly new prospects, thereby opening it up to entirely new strata of investors, which in turn increases its values.     Strategic relevance:     This applies to companies that are clearly future candidates for strategic buyers but which still need 2-4 years to be ""ripe for purchase"".     Or better yet:     a combination of several different catalysts Since we work constructively with all the stakeholders to implement the changes needed, our strategy can be succinctly described as “friendly activism.” Stock market listing provides high flexibility Heliad’s greatest advantage is that it is structured as a so-called “evergreen” vehicle, which means that, as opposed to a mutual fund or hedge fund, it is not subject to possible outflows but rather has permanent equity. The fact that Heliad is listed provides shareholders with liquidity since they can trade its shares daily. This allows Heliad to act independently of term financing and make both investment and disinvestment decisions on a case-by-case basis, which provides for a high degree of flexibility."

Healionics,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/healionics,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Medical, Medical Device","Healionics has applied its expertise in synthetic biomaterials to develop a novel vascular graft (artificial blood vessel) that, unlike existing grafts, remains open to blood flow long-term without need for costly interventions.  Its first commercial application will be as a more reliable means of vascular access for dialysis patients, with a subsequent application to treat peripheral artery disease.  We have great results in multiple controlled animal studies, a large patent portfolio, established production capacity, and are ready to begin human studies later this year in preparation for market launch. Near-Term Problem / Market Opportunity:  Vascular Access for Dialysis Kidney failure patients need to have their blood filtered 3 times per week via dialysis.  This removes waste from the blood, which would otherwise cause them to die.  However, current methods for repeatedly accessing the bloodstream for dialysis are unreliable.  This problem is a huge contributor to the $50 billion per year that the U.S. spends on dialysis patients (7% of Medicare’s entire budget!).  A vascular graft is often implanted under the skin (connecting an artery to a vein) to create an access site with sufficient bloodflow for dialysis -- but existing grafts tend to occlude quickly, requiring repeated expensive interventions to keep them open. Solution:  STARgraft Because our vascular graft remains open to blood flow much longer than existing grafts, it can potentially satisfy a severe unmet clinical need for ready-to-use, safe, long-term dialysis access, while substantially reducing costs, illness and death rate among dialysis patients. Product Pipeline We have additional products in development, including an implantable port which will allow needle-free dialysis.  Eliminating the use of needles would further reduce cost and illness among dialysis patients, and allow them to perform dialysis in the convenience of their own home.  In addition, our platform STAR biomaterial can improve the performance of a wide range of implantable devices via its remarkable ability to prevent both infection and scar tissue.  We currently have two corporate-funded development contracts to explore STAR material’s use in multiple other device applications. "

HeadCheck Health,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/headcheck-health,"Health Care, Mobile, Sports","HeadCheck Health is changing the world by making effective concussion testing and protocol implementation easier. Further, it enables team/league administrators to make informed actionable decisions that increase player safety and minimize concussion mismanagement risk by providing an objective method to know if their concussion protocol is effective. The product itself, HeadCheck, is a complete solution for teams/leagues at all levels of play and sport-focused clinics that are looking for a better way to implement and execute concussion protocols. It includes an easy-to-use mobile software that simplifies standardized test methods, onboarding services (e.g. assisted baseline testing, training, certification of users), and compliance reporting.  HeadCheck’s mobile application is used by teams for pre-season baseline testing, post-injury testing following suspected head injuries, and tracking recovery towards RTP. Tests are based off today’s most scientifically-backed methods and include 10 concussion indicators, such as: symptoms, cognitive function, vestibular-ocular motor screening, and standing balance. For organizations without medical staff, testing methodology and decision-making abilities are limited to what is appropriate for lay individuals, allowing them to make appropriate decisions and collect important information to support external medical professionals. Test results can be instantly compared to previous results, such as baseline tests, for a personalized view of the athlete’s concussive status. Results can also be securely shared with parents, coaches, or other medical professionals involved in the well-being of the athlete. Test results and notes follow athletes from team-to-team and sport-to-sport, allowing for informed decisions regardless of when or where an injury occurs throughout their life. Monthly and year-end compliance reporting provides administrators objective findings from team and user-specific analyses, such as whether teams are regularly testing, how many games are being lost from concussion, teams/users with inappropriate testing or protocol adherence, and whether certain fields/arenas report higher rates of concussive injury. Sport-focused clinicians such as physiotherapists, athletic therapists, and chiropractors have begun to expand in-clinic offerings to provide baseline, post-injury, and RTP concussion management. The goal is to provide a standardized tool for clinics to implement best practice concussion care with their patients, increase brand awareness and loyalty with clinicians, and increase the number of athletes being actively managed on the platform. This program is meant to compliment the Company’s team/league product and generate the mass-adoption and awareness required to make HeadCheck the de-facto standard for concussion testing and management in sport.

HelioZenit,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/heliozenit,"Energy, Solar","HelioZenit Ab was founded in Finland in 2008 from a spin-off project of a company specializing in the storage of solar energy on a household scale. The project that led to the creation of HelioZenit Ab had the purpose of maximizing the amount of generated solar energy per area of thermal collector, thereby maximizing the amount of stored energy for the household. We recognized early on that in order to get maximum output from the sun the solar collectors would always need to be directed straight towards the sun; not only at noon but constantly tracking the sun from sunrise until sunset. What originally was a project focusing on thermal solar energy was later expanded into photovoltaic electricity, the principle of turning the panels to follow the sun for maximum output remaining the same. Many large utility solar stations use this principle as they build huge tracking units on massive concrete columns carrying up to 50 and more panels per unit. The Heliomotion Home Solar Power Plant is a light version of the utility trackers, designed to provide private homes with an extremely efficient, affordable and easy way to generate their own renewable energy. A Heliomotion is designed to be easily assembled and installed in less than a day by the buyer. This is a huge cost saver as no construction crew and no lifting equipment is needed. The Heliomotion Home Solar Power Plant is delivered as a complete installation kit on one pallet, including a detailed, illustrated installation manual. The composition of the kit is optimized for maximum ease of handling, with no single piece weighing more than 20 kg."
