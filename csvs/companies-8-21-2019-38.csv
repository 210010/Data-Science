Mereo's focus is the development of innovative medicines that have the potential to significantly transform the lives of patients suffering from rare and other specialised conditions around the world.  To do this, the Company depends on the combination of its team's expertise in selecting and acquiring product opportunities, creating value in the development pipeline and structuring creative transactions. Mereo's internal expertise is complemented by a unique partnership with a leading global CRO, ICON.

MEG Energy,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/meg-energy,"Energy, Oil and Gas, Renewable Energy","MEG Energy Corp. is a Canadian oil sands company focused on sustainable in situ development and production in the southern Athabasca oil sands region of Alberta. MEG has acquired a large, high-quality resource base – one that they believe holds some of the best in situ resources in Alberta. With these resources and a well-formulated strategic growth plan, MEG is positioned to be a strong oil sands player for many years to come. MEG also owns interests in two key midstream assets: Access Pipeline and Stonefell Terminal. Access Pipeline, a 50%-owned joint venture with Devon Energy, connects their Christina Lake Project to a main transportation hub in Edmonton, ultimately providing access for their product to multiple end markets. Stonefell Terminal, is a wholly-owned 900,000 barrel storage facility that was completed in late 2013. It allows MEG to mitigate risks with pipeline restrictions and acquire and store diluent during favourable market conditions. A proprietary pipeline connects Stonefell Terminal to the Canexus Bruderheim rail facility, establishing the first wellhead to unit train connection via pipeline in Canada. Together, these assets provide MEG with a number of unique cost and revenue advantages that allow us to add significant value to each barrel they produce. MEG continually seeks opportunities to incorporate technologies that can strengthen their marketing options and develop additional opportunities. These include their Diluent Removal Facility and HI-Q® demonstration project. In 2013, MEG announced plans to construct a diluent removal facility that will be connected to Stonefell Terminal. This technology will recycle diluents needed to move their heavy crude by rail and return them to their Christina Lake project via the Access Pipeline. The resulting product “railbit”, can be transported by rail to refining markets across the continent. MEG’s proprietary HI-Q® technology has been successfully demonstrated on a smaller scale to modify bitumen blends to a product suitable for shipping by pipeline without diluent, at significantly reduced environmental impacts relative to conventional oil sands upgrading processes. In 2014, MEG commenced construction of the HI-Q® Field Demonstration Pilot. As part of their overall marketing efforts, these technologies are focused on reducing both their diluent requirements and their transportation costs.  Guiding the development of their resource base and strategic plans is a highly experienced team. Their company is home to some of the industry’s top talent, boasting decades of experience that span nearly every thermal oil sands project developed in Alberta over the past 20 years. They hire individuals who share their commitment to excellence in all that they do and those who are passionate about responsible energy development."

Mentor Capital,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mentor-capital,"Banking, Cannabis, Finance","Mentor Capital, Inc. (MNTR) is a public company that invests in medical and social use cannabis companies. Mentor takes a 10% to 100% position in the various members of our family of participating companies, but leaves operating control firmly in the hands of the cannabis company founders. Because adult social use and medical marijuana opportunities often overlap, Mentor Capital participates in the legal recreational marijuana market. However, Mentor’s preferred focus is medical and the company seeks to facilitate the application of cannabis to cancer wasting, calming seizures, Parkinson’s disease, reducing ocular pressures from glaucoma and blunting chronic pain. Mentor’s approach and capital structure allows its shareholders to buy an additional $140 million of Mentor shares at approximately a 12.5% discount. As money is sent in to buy into the growing cannabis portfolio, the proceeds are split pro rata amongst the cannabis companies that are participating in the indirect sale. As more private cannabis companies join in the consortium, the MNTR share price is pushed higher, other things being equal. The increasing share price may well increase the exercise of stock options and warrants by both Mentor Capital’s 1,500 mostly accredited shareholders and the public market in general. Using this approach, Mentor seeks to deliver a higher price to founders for a smaller slice of their business. Retaining control and receiving more cash are the two key advantages to cannabis founders working with Mentor Capital, Inc. Mentor Capital migrated to the cannabis space from leading-edge cancer investments when government actions collapsed the new leading cancer sector (e.g. Dendreon, the market leader, dropped from $44 per share to $2.90 per share.) Mentor still retains some cancer investments, but will complete the shift to the cannabis marketplace as profitable opportunities to exit present themselves. Originally, Mentor Capital was formed in Silicon Valley in 1985 with $1,000 by current CEO, Chet Billingsley. The company completed dozens of early private acquisitions and went public in 1995. Mentor Capital feels there is significant opportunity to approach the medical marijuana market as a business-focused, high-integrity, public company providing significantly more financing to private cannabis companies. As a result, Mentor will be able to return increasing stock value to the investing public. As a distinct first step in this direction, the Mentor CEO has placed his shares in escrow with a law firm to obviate the risk of pump and dump activity that has otherwise been associated by regulators with other public marijuana related firms. Cannabis related firms seeking a larger amount of long-term cooperative financing, for a smaller slice of their business, are encouraged to contact Mentor Capital to discuss reserving their pro rata portion of Mentor’s $140 million authorized raise."

Metabolomic Diagnostics,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/metabolomic-diagnostics,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Health Diagnostics","Metabolomic Diagnostics Ltd., is collaborating with University College Cork, Ireland, (UCC) and the Cork University Maternity Hospital (CUMH) on the development of groundbreaking predictive pregnancy diagnostics. Their predictive diagnostic tests have the potential to transform maternal and fetal care globally, delivering on both of the key drivers in healthcare: improved quality of care and reduced costs.  Pre-eclampsia is a disease of late pregnancy characterised by the concomitant occurrence of hypertension (high blood pressure) and proteinuria (elevated protein in the urine) leading to restricted blood supply to the foetus. The condition begins in early pregnancy with defective development of the placenta but most often does not manifest itself until the second half of pregnancy. Once diagnosed, the only treatment option is the delivery of the baby prematurely. Latest research shows that the condition has been the most significant cause of maternal death over recent decades and is responsible for occupancy of approximately 20% of neonatal intensive care unit cots. Between 70,000 and 80,000 women die every year from pre-eclampsia and in excess of half a million new born infants die annually as a direct result of the condition.  Identification of first time mothers at risk for these conditions is the first step to effective intervention and prevention. Prenatal care currently consists of a series of consultations during pregnancy with a doctor or midwife. The main reason for these checks is to detect early signs of hypertension and proteinuria. The standard intervals between prenatal visits may result in delays in diagnosis with an increased chance of severe complications. If at risk first time mothers could be identified in early pregnancy, known and emerging therapies could potentially prevent or treat the condition. In the US alone the cost of prenatal care associated with pre-eclampsia is over $7 billion. The World Health Organization recently concluded that there is currently no cost effective or reliable screening test for pre-eclampsia. As a consequence, clinicians are unable to offer either targeted surveillance or potential preventative therapies to those at risk.  Metabolomic Diagnostics will offer a revolutionary blood test to be administered at 15 weeks into a pregnancy, which can predict with a high degree of accuracy and negligible false negatives, the risk that a woman will develop preeclampsia later in their pregnancy.  A combination of metabolites in the blood is measured and the results, along with certain clinical data are fed into a classification algorithm, which extrapolates the results. This information will allow clinicians to tailor specific medical care to patients who are at higher risk of developing pre-eclampsia.  Current work aims to validate and commercially develop the diagnostic platform and should be ready to commence a hospital later this year."

In the long run, the company wants to develop novel multifunctional treatment for traumatic brain injury (TBI), as well as for brain injury due to stroke. This medication could potentially prevent the development of chronic conditions such as Parkinson's disease, Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), or epilepsy. All these conditions are due to multitude of blows to the head as suffered by, for example, boxers such as Mohammad Ali. Medicortex Finland Oy was founded in June 2014 as a BioTurku member; its laboratories are located in the Turku Science Park Bioincubator. The company was awarded a Tekes grant by the government of Finland to develop new drugs to halt the process of neuronal degradation that persists following brain injury.  Medicortex’s aim is to develop a simple, easy-to-use and relatively cheap test based on a biomarker found in one of the body fluids. Ideally, the test could be applied within minutes of the initial insult. A biomarker diagnostic test for TBI may be of use in identifying individuals with severe TBI, who are at risk of secondary brain injury and therefore require increased surveillance, or for those individuals with mild TBI, who otherwise may remain undiagnosed and untreated. Diagnostic test can also be applied in cases where there are no external signs of injury, for example for soldiers exposed to blast or explosion injuries."

MP-101 is an orally-active modulator of glutamate signalling in spine and brain. Glutamate signalling has long been a sought-after target for the development of new central nervous system drug candidates. MP-101 is a particularly well-suited candidate, with outstanding pharmaceutic properties; it is a small molecule, obtained by a straight-forward chemical manufacturing process. It is also orally active in a wide range of rodent models of central nervous system disorders, such as depression, cognition, or neuropathic pain. MP-101 is a patent-pending non-racemic mixture of the left-handed and right-handed versions (the ""enantiomers"") of dimiracetam. It is not a one-to-one mixture (a ""racemate""), but a ratio that has been chosen because it is - unexpectedly - considerably more potent pharmacologically than the racemate. While the one-to-one mixture has long been known to be superior to either of the two single-handed enantiomers alone, Metys Pharmaceuticals has discovered that certain mixtures of dimiracetam enantiomers are far more potent still.  Metys Pharmaceuticals has licensed the world-wide exclusive rights to racemic dimiracetam from Neurotune AG, including the entire dossier of regulatory studies supporting clinical trials of racemic dimiracetam. Metys Pharmaceuticals now aims to use these pharmacological, toxicological and clinical data obtained with racemic dimiracetam to support the future clinical trials of MP-101."

MessageLabs,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/messagelabs,"Information Technology, Security","MessageLabs, now part of [Symantec](/organization/symantec) and known as Symantec.cloud, was founded in 1999 with a single purpose — to find a better way to stop the new breed of viruses that were harnessing the power of Internet to spread rapidly and causing huge disruption to the business world. Traditional anti-virus software was designed in a pre-Internet age. Reactive in nature it was proving to be ineffective at stopping this new breed of viruses. Every threat should be stopped long before it reaches you. MessageLabs was the first company in the world to introduce anti-virus as a service rather than software, delivered within the fabric of the Internet, that was able to stop threats long before they reached their intended targets, could learn from the huge volumes of messages being processed and was able to draw on far greater resources than would be possible within a single organization. The result was a truly revolutionary anti-virus service that gained worldwide recognition for stopping and naming the Lovebug virus hours before any other vendor heralding a new era in the industry. MessageLabs has built on this successful model and extended our vision to provide complete certainty in the exchange of all business information, regardless of protocol, device or location. The company continues to innovate as messaging evolves — now with some 19 patents granted or pending."

Our vision is to leverage MeMeMe's proprietary advantage in speaker-personalized accuracy, available anywhere, to become ""the voice interface to everything"".   Mobile devices and services are the largest, fastest growing technology market.  The biggest consumer technology firms in the world, including Google, Microsoft, and Apple, have made speech recognition a strategic initiative for 2012, because they believe accurate voice interfaces provide a significantly better mobile user experience, driving up usage and revenue.  Personalization and centralization are major long-term success factors: necessary to achieve the consistent accuracy and seamless experience required for broad consumer adoption.  The direct market for mobile and IVR voice interfaces, transcription services, and unified communications is well over $30 billion annually, growing over 40% per year, and the potential value of an effective ""voice interface to everything"" utility is far higher, driving hundreds of billions annually in mobile commerce and services."
