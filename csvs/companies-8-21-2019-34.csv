So of course, when the opportunity to open a restaurant came up, I jumped on it. Owning my own restaurant really opened my eyes to the struggles a local business goes through, but also how awesome and powerful a group of regular customers can be.  I strived to give them consistently great service, which isn't always easy when I am not at the restaurant myself. I designed the inKind mobile app as a way to reward my best customers for their continued loyalty and also to ensure that they have a great experience whenever they come in.

Injectsense,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/injectsense,Medical Device,"A Serious Unmet Need -- with Significant Quality-of-Life Implications They live in a new era where they are constantly connected. They receive remote updates on almost all information critical to their lives and lifestyle, and they have the ability to monitor event status and to predict and plan for change. Yet in the medical field, a physician treating a progressive disease often has no choice but to be reactive -- often with harmful results. Critical data on patient disease state is collected infrequently during sporadic office visits, yielding only a single data point to interpret past trends and assess long-term risk. Unlike their personal updates, continously available via sensors, GIS, and smart phone connectivity, there is no continuous stream of physiological measurement data from patients that can allow physicians to track and anticipate changes in disease status. The medical team cannot see how patient activity may be affecting disease indicators, and they can't see whether patients are even complying with drug therapy. The end result? More patient visits to the ER and doctor's office -- often when physiological damage has already been done. Injectsense: A New Paradigm for Therapy Management Injectsense enables tracking of progressive disease indicators and improved therapy management by providing continuous, clinically actionable information through an injectable ultra-miniature sensor coupled with a secure digital health platform. Their sensor, which can be delivered during a doctor's office visit, transforms the care model by enabling medical teams to track the disease at the pace of its evolution, whether months or years, receive early warning signs and provide preventive therapy. The configurable-on-demand sensor monitors patients 24/7, requires no patient lifestyle changes and reduces the need for medical office visits. More significantly, it allows physicians to establish an individual patient baseline for comparison, to receive data quickly at any time of day, to see histories and hourly dynamic disease state before irreversible damage is done, and to increase the effectiveness of drug therapy by tracking the effects of pharmaceuticals on key indicators over time."
