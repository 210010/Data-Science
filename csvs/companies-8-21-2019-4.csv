After verification and attestation, they can start delivering parcels around the city. Couriers can choose to work just a few hours a day on the way to university, or they can work full time and have orders assigned to them automatically by company’s smart robot.  Dostavista develops proprietary algorithms that evaluate several dozen features in real-time and pick the best courier for the job. Special attention is paid to the quality of service and theft prevention. Delivery is verified by scanning of QR code, recipient signature and photo of the parcel. Smart contracts manage the release of payments and fees. Orders can also be insured.  Over 200k shops use Dostavista worldwide, including big chains such as Krispy Kreme(in Russia and Turkey) and Euroset - Russia's largest electronic retail chain. Scale and experience from numerous markets with different mentalities help Dostavista achieve its goal of making delivery invisible."

Dumpling,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dumpling-9c1d,Marketplace,"The beginnings of dumpling started with their original focus on building a community for workers to share their voice and promote positive change at their workplace. The voices of thousands of independent contractors in the Gig Economy quickly jumped out and grabbed their attention. While on-demand apps like Instacart and Uber have quickly grown in popularity and success, the experience and day to day realities of the workers that make these apps and services so successful is quite the opposite. Many of the independent contractors that they talked to loved their jobs but absolutely hated the way they were being treated by the on-demand apps they worked for (check out an article they wrote about Instacart here). Many were considering starting their own businesses to allow them to keep doing the type of work they love and to also get out from the horrible working conditions that they were experiencing. The challenge they were facing: how to build the technology that’s required for them to create a business in today’s on-demand economy. That’s where they stepped in. Could they create a business and technology platform that provides everything an independent contractor needed to run their own business? As shoppers from Instacart were experiencing some of the harshest realities of working for an on-demand app, they decided to start there. They are currently focused on providing the best tools that personal shoppers need to create local businesses that compete with the national grocery delivery apps. With dumpling, shoppers can provide a number of benefits over the status quo; including the ability to shop at any store (think local!), clients getting the same shopper every time (think personalized service!), and in-store pricing with no hidden markups (think savings!)."

Our Innovative API Automation Platform literally generates the REST API: fully documented, live, secured, and standardized with API best practices in place, allowing you to connect to over 60+ data source and service with just a few simple clicks. We believe we offer a solution in the API space that is not just an incremental improvement over our competitors, but a significant leap in terms of the amount of time, headaches, and developer resources we will save you. Our platform incorporates more than a decade of deep experience involving how to securely build, deploy, and manage service-based applications in the enterprise. Dreamfactory can be installed on any server, connected to any SQL or NoSQL database, and used for developing HTML5 or native mobile applications. Our technology enables developers to build modern applications for the phone, tablet, or desktop without having to manage server-side code and complexity. - Dreamfactory has innovated beyond this technology to be able to connect to anything instantly and provide a fully reusable, standardized REST API with full documentation. You do not need to rely on the DreamFactory engineering roadmap to handle emergent technologies - we will not be a bottleneck (nor try to gouge you for Non-Recurring Engineering fees to build a new connection) for your API needs. - Dreamfactory also uses this REST API auto-generation to integrate anything almost instantly, completely on-premise, so that you can achieve complete IT environment homogenization inside a couple of months. This is achieved through the standardized way that APIs are deployed, meaning you are eliminating backend complexity for your development teams. - If RESTification is the way forward for you, DreamFactory is the fastest and most enterprise-friendly way of doing it, because you get unlimited connections with a Dreamfactory license for significantly less cost; hence, you can scale Dreamfactory across your organization in a way that SnapLogic cannot. - Dreamfactory additionally has unique API Orchestration capabilities that allow you to raise your team’s data quality through allowing you to combine data from different data sources, or combine data from different tables within the same data source, with a single API call. This capability offers a new best practice in enterprise gateways. - Finally, we have GraphQL autogeneration just around the corner and have new security updates about to be released that will make Dreamfactory the most secure API Management solution. We were built from the ground up based on the frustrations with the learning curve required for API solutions like Mulesoft and SnapLogic - and is why we have clients like McKesson (#6 on the Fortune 500 list) stating that Dreamfactory is significantly easier and cheaper than [major competitor], and wishing they found us sooner."

DARPA,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/darpa,"Artificial Intelligence, Information Technology, National Security","The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency was created with a national sense of urgency in February 1958 amidst one of the most dramatic moments in the history of the Cold War and the already-accelerating pace of technology. In the months preceding the official authorization for the agency's creation, Department of Defense Directive Number 5105.15, the Soviet Union had launched an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM), the world's first satellite, Sputnik 1, and the world's second satellite, two months after Sputnik 1, resulted in a spectacular fiery failure. Finally, at the end of January 1958, a stunned United States became the second nation to place an object in orbit when it successfully launched the Explorer 1 satellite. Out of this traumatic experience of technological surprise in the first moments of the Space Age, U.S. leadership created DARPA, initially with the shorter name Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). In the nearly 60 years since it was established, DARPA has owned the critical mission of keeping the United States out front when it comes to cultivating breakthrough technologies for national security rather than in a position of catching up to strategically important innovations and achievements of others. With no research and development facilities of its own, DARPA has become known as a laboratory and incubator of innovation by providing thought leadership, community-building frameworks, technology challenges, research management, funding, and other cultural and infrastructural support elements that it takes to usher transformative ideas toward consequential new realities."

These are lowered a mile deep down vertical drill holes lined with steel casing, and then inserted into horizontal storage portions that are several miles long. The waste is placed in sedimentary formations that have demonstrated geologic stability and impermeability by having contained volatile gases for tens of millions of years.

An avid fisherman, Dick was approached by the store owner to come up with a list of products needed to get into the fishing tackle business. After Dick presented his suggestions, the owner told him he was a dumb kid and had no idea what he was doing. Dick was upset and promptly quit. He went to his grandmother’s house where he spent a lot of time as a kid and told her what had happened. Dick’s grandmother asked how much it would cost to build the store himself. Dick said it would cost $300. His grandmother then went to the cookie jar where she kept her life savings and gave him $300 and told him “do it yourself.” Dick used that money and his relentless work-ethic to open a bait-and-tackle shop in Binghamton. By 1958, he expanded his product line to include much of what you’ll find at DICK’S Sporting Goods today. Ed Stack, Dick’s son, is the current CEO and Chairman of DICK’S Sporting Goods. He and his siblings bought the store from their father and are responsible for taking two stores and growing the chain to over 500 stores. Dick’s family continues to offer the finest quality products at competitive prices, backed by the best service anywhere. Like you, they have a real passion for sports.

The birth of DIB Hotel took place when founders came up with the idea to give the customers the power to set their own prices. A DIB customer may place a bid along with some hotel preferences, the bid is automatically sent to all hotels which match the customer's preferences and the first hotel to accept the bid wins the customer. The hotel’s brand is only exposed to that certain customer and the brand is therefore well protected. In the end, the customer strikes a great deal and the hotel can increase its occupancy rate without hurting its brand – that’s what they call a win-win situation."

By applying its innovative ultra-thin and durable coating solutions, DropWise serves enormous markets that were previously inaccessible by conventional coating technologies. Heat exchangers are a crucial part of every thermal fluid system, from the intercoolers and radiators used to cool cars and trucks, to the condensers and evaporators that drive HVAC/R equipment, to the massive boilers and condensers that drive manufacturing processes and power plants. They rely on very thin heat transfer surfaces that are extremely sensitive to fouling and corrosion, which creates a process bottleneck and forces operators to either reduce output capacity, consume more energy to compensate, or shut down completely to clean the affected heat exchanger.  For all of these problems, conventional liquid-based anti-fouling and anti-corrosion coatings are too thick, and often make the problem worse by insulating the heat transfer surfaces. Faced with this unacceptable performance tradeoff, the status quo is to leave the equipment uncoated and to bear the significant costs of the fouling and corrosion that inevitably occur. Using an innovative vapor-based deposition process, DropWise coatings are chemically grafted to virtually any surface and built up to precise thicknesses. The chemical grafting provides an extremely durable bond that has surpassed testing under severe industrial conditions, and the coating thicknesses can be tuned to nanometer precision to be hundreds of times thinner than conventional coatings. DropWise has secured a license to the MIT patent applications, and is developing a coating platform built from a wide library of precursor materials to address different applications. Low surface energy coatings are used to break up insulating films of condensate into droplets, enabling a 7x increase in heat transfer that allows the coating to boost the efficiency of a wide range of processes, from steam power generation and desalination to HVAC/R and chemical processing; while another chemically inert formulation is used to protect against corrosive environments."
