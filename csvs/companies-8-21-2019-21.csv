The 9 ft. van Matt ordered was sold out, leaving them with an enormous 20 ft. truck.

Matt would go on to make this his focus at business school, where he met fellow students Jay Manickam and Mickey Millsap.

This complex structure involves dynamic resource sharing over a hyper-converged compute, storage and network physical infrastructure, all supported by a layer of virtualization technologies. This new, integrated approach to data center architecture offers tremendous operational and business advantages to organizations whose success is dependent upon reliable application service delivery. However, data center monitoring solutions and technology developments have not kept pace with this new wave in data center architecture. Current tools have reinforced the established silos that separate applications, virtual infrastructure, and physical infrastructure as well as the supporting IT teams within the data center. As a result, data center teams have no inter-silo visibility and are unable to efficiently connect the dots between infrastructure and application performance. Uila has a transformational vision that addresses this problem, and empowers data center infrastructure and application teams with a revolutionary new collaborative solution that effectively visualizes and automatically correlates application performance to virtual and physical infrastructure root cause.

Unequal Technologies,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/unequal-technologies-company,"Health Care, Manufacturing, Sporting Goods, Sports","Unequal Technologies was founded by Robert Vito when he was an adjunct professor in the Penn State Graduate Business Program. Teaching coursework on entrepreneurship and accounting to up-and-coming business professionals, Rob was challenged by a student who wondered whether bulletproof armor could be made lighter and more flexible. After many years of research and over $10 million dollars in funding, the answer is UNEQUAL, a revolutionary composite that promises to reduce the pain and injury associated with impacts. The multilayer product was originally developed for military applications, and was tested under incredibly stringent guidelines issued by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), the organization that certifies bullet-resistant armor. UNEQUAL’s unique composite material, fortified with DuPont Kevlar® aramid fibers, works by stopping bullets and dispersing the impact energy of projectiles, helping the wearer to remain safe. The shock-blocking technology served to protect the wearer from impact injuries and bullet wounds sustained on the battlefield, and was adopted by soldiers, law enforcement personnel, and government agents. The technology behind these innovative products is backed by over 85 U.S. and international patents and extensive testing from independent, accredited laboratories the world over. OEM facilities and university science programs have verified the effectiveness of the shock-absorbing protective gear. The product was soon applied to the task of protecting those involved in professional sports. It first found favor in pro sports among NFL players, who flocked to the company’s protective wear. Now, the protective products can be found in body armor and helmet padding among dozens of players in the football league, and other sports governing bodies like the NHL and Major League Baseball have begun to use the products to help protect players. For action sports like the X Games, the lightweight protective products are ideal in that they protect against injuries while remaining flexible and easy to wear, even in extreme conditions. The protective head and body gear is vastly superior to other protective products on the market, especially those constructed of plastic and foam. The layered composite material in UNEQUAL’s protective product line is tough and resilient, able to withstand the abuse that collision and action sports can create. Collegiate and youth athletes in disciplines like baseball, lacrosse, soccer, hockey, and football can benefit from the protection UNEQUAL’s products provide. Products are designed to be affordable and can be customized for specific sporting applications and body types, giving the athlete tremendous flexibility while warding off the injuries and pain associated with sports impacts. UNEQUAL and its products have received several prominent awards for innovation in the field of protective sportswear. The company was recognized by Forbes as one of the magazine’s 100 Most Promising Companies. Thanks to our work with DuPont, the manufacturing company presented UNEQUAL with its Kevlar® Innovation Award in 2012. In 2013, Esquire, ESPN, and Inc. Magazine all listed the company and its products among the most important tech innovations for the year. The industry publication Composites Manufacturing called the company “The Industry’s Best” that same year, showcasing the protective gear’s growth from military origins to sporting applications and its future in protecting actors in movie and television productions, among many other roles."

For several years, negotiations about possibility of joint activity were held with a number of Internet entrepreneurs.

The average purchase check on the partners sites Price.ua is about 2.5 thousand UAH. Later the platforms sravni.ua, trud.ua, urok.trud.ua, zagran.trud.ua, rul.ua, metry.ua were purchased and launched. In 2012, Andrey Bronetsky - the general director of one of the world's largest dating sites Mamba.ru. joined the committee of UCG Board members In early 2012, Bronezky bought the domain Aport.ru from the Russian telecommunications company VimpelCom for 150 thousand dollars.

These parameters are unacceptable for manned and autonomous transportation in cities. That is arise the following problems for manned navigation: skipping proper turns and making wrong turns, getting on improper driveway or taking false exit on road junctions, loss of navigation and jumps of position in: urban canyons, financial districts, sky scrapers blocks, narrow and dense built areas; loss of navigation and incorrect positioning in city tunnels, nearby viaducts and overpasses, absence of navigation inside underground, under roof, multilevel parking lots, no seamless outdoor/indoor navigation.

Auto insurance Auto insurance problem: it is a must to have precise motion trajectories of manned and autonomous vehicles’ in absolute and relative coordinates in case of collision happened. Traditional and unmanned vehicles collide today and will collide in future for various reasons. Perfectly reconstructed trajectories based on robust motion data opens the opportunity for automatic arbitration and resolution of road traffic incidents and accidents. Achievable centimeter accuracy of relative and decimeter accuracy of absolute positioning is the core technology for automatic collisions arbitration. High labor costs of “manual” non-automatic settlement of traffic accidents and insurance cases nowadays. Bottom line: no clear picture of road traffic accident, no data to judge who is responsible for crash, no data for crash analysis.  Urbanavtic technology  Urbanavtic’s auto insurance technology solution is founded on: precise relative positioning (estimation of the location displacement) based on phase measurements of GNSS and transferring to absolute coordinates using map matching methods and image-based positioning. Here we use applied measurements: GNSS raw data, primarily the accumulated phases and MEMS IMU sensors, image frames from camera. Dynamic adaptation of data processing based on a constant analysis of consistency of measurements from the phase tracking channels. Exact reconstruction of vehicles’ trajectories based on entire set of kinematic parameters including accelerations, velocities and angular velocities. Hereby we have opened the opportunity for automatic arbitration of road traffic accidents, cut costs of insurance companies, save time and money for drivers. Demonstration of results The video of the technology real time tests on Android smartphone will be demonstrated in the frame of presentation. Interested customers will be welcome for field tests. "
