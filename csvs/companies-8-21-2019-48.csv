Unfortunately, Math lessons are not written this way!

In Wade7.com, they are changing that! They re-write math lessons as stories and they relate them to real world applications that students use everyday. They then produce these lessons as animated videos that are not more than 3 min long each. They also provide students with a lot of exercises to solve so they can make sure they understood the lessons. Their product will have the inherited benefits of the internet.

We offer a network of mobile guides that support travelers with a handy tool for smartphones and tablets to discover the best of a territory. The main focus of our guides is to enable a more genuine experience of the territory, providing travelers with everything they need to enjoy a city or a territory at its fullest - from local “pills of wisdom” about what to do and to see there to the access to services related to their staying, such as accommodation, dining, transportation, etc. Although travel is a crowded market, we feel that there is a big opportunity for us.  We’ve always been keen travelers and our experience taught us that when you’re planning a journey, you usually have a hard time trying to discern the trusted sources of information among the many options you have because of fake reviews, outdated information and poor suggestions.  That’s why we created Wami. Wami is like the local friend you would call for advice.  Our mobile guides combine up-to-date information of general interest coming from open data and social data with unique local tips. Content is taken from selected sources, validated and optimized: it features the main points of interest in the area and all the activities you can enjoy during the day and at night. Wami apps are free for the final users and boast state-of-the-art design, offline maps, offline content and a smart geolocated system called Amerigo, that can suggest you what to do according to your position, the time of the day and the weather conditions.  Also, users can count on geolocated services that are displayed in the exact moment they might need them. We take maximum care for the user experience, that we believe should be an outstanding travel experience, enabled and improved by technology. Wami is already on the market with 25 applications - native applications for iOS and Android devices and a HTML5 version that we developed as technical partners of local editors.  We’re currently switching to a new business model, though, where our philosophy is further enhanced and Wami has full control of the process. We are starting to profile our users and implementing a pay-per-person marketing strategy. The company is based in Treviso, Italy. We’re 6 people and 5 of us are software engineers. The founders, Enrico and Carlo, are both developers and they’ve been working together for over ten years. Carlo is currently in London, UK to explore the international opportunities for Wami. Our goal is to entirely cover Italy and to extend our reach to Europe and eventually overseas and we are looking for a seed investment to sustain both product development and business development."

It must create: a feeling of belonging to a united, human-centered organization; happiness, the natural driver for productivity; empathy, for sinergy between colleagues of all departments and company locations; informal relations , the true glue for a successful company community. YOUR PEOPLE, HAPPY AS THEY ARE. Walife is the only life app that switches your community on and makes it thrive. How? With its unique user experience and its new passion-based algorithm. Behind each colleague there is a world of passions and interests (#trekking, #familytime, #soccer, #theater, #guitar, and thousands more). Walife makes them live and match, creating fun and useful connections among coworkers from all departments and company locations. Yes, Walife is not for work tasks. Walife is for creating the pillars on which a modern successful company relies on: fruitful human relations. Think about it as a big, virtual coffee-break room where all colleagues are finally able to know each other, share common passions, organize fun activities, find opportunities, promote exchange and more. EMOTIONAL ENGAGEMENT. Companies need their people to be on-board, not just as professionals, but as whole persons. While Walife promotes lively human relations, internal sentiment and employee engagement improve. Here, connections grow based on people and mutual passions, rather than work and roles. SPONTANEOUS, NATURAL TEAM BUILDING. Although important, classic team building is often top-down and unaware of coworkers’ true interests. Through interest-matching, Walife enables an easier, peer-to-peer, natural team building. Fun drivers or utility drivers let people group up, while spontaneously creating a stronger community. OPPORTUNITIES FROM COLLEAGUES. Along with fun and passions, usefulness is a powerful driver for creating a community. With Walife’s algorithm, colleagues easily share tips on relevant life issues, they exchange goods and much more  (p2p work-life balance). In short, they discover how useful and worthwhile their community can be. BENEFITS ON TARGET. Peer-to-peer fun and usefulness build a great community for all colleagues. Now, the company can use the community to be a great partner for the life of its people. With Walife’s algorithm, welfare initiatives and benefits can be promoted and targeted on the app, increasing satisfaction and conversion rates. THIS IS WALIFE. Switch your community on, and let it thrive. Give your people a long-lasting gift and let them connect with Walife. Want more? Walife generates unprecedented, cumulative and real-time knowledge on your people and your community. You can use it to improve your HR strategies and your business, helped by Walife's angels."

WatchFacts,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/watchfacts,E-Commerce,"The savvier shoppers among us understand that buying pre-owned luxury watches is the smart way to go. After all, pre-owned fine timepieces already took their biggest depreciation hit when the first buyer left the retail store. And since high-end watches are built to last several lifetimes, the only thing you’re really missing by buying an authentic watch in great condition from the secondary market is the hefty retail price tag.  However, just like any secondary market, there are some precautions to take to ensure that you’re getting your money’s worth. The pre-owned luxury watch space is a robust market with plenty of sources to buy and sell used timepieces. But, how do you know if the seller is a trustworthy one and more importantly, how do you know if the watch you’re buying is the real deal? Enter WatchFacts, a third-party certification program that does all the work for you so you know exactly what you’re buying.   Just like customers depend on Carfax reports to inform them about the history of a used car, WatchFacts provides detailed certification reports about secondhand luxury watches. Using a proprietary grading system and a standardized inspection process, a WatchFacts Report includes a WatchFacts Score, which gives you a quick overview of the overall condition of the watch.  A top WatchFacts Score of 100 indicates that the watch is in unworn/like new condition, followed by different scores for excellent, very good, and so on. Along with the score, a WatchFacts Report provides other essential information such as brand, model, date of production, movement, materials, authenticity check, theft check, current performance, and information about any previous servicing.  Buying from a WatchFacts partner network minimizes your risk when purchasing from the secondary luxury watch market since you’ll have access to a WatchFacts Report. Plus, seeing as WatchFacts’ goal is customer peace of mind, if something goes wrong, WatchFacts will intercede on your behalf so you are content with your purchase.  Shoppers can take advantage of a vast selection of products by buying certified pre-owned luxury watches from Amazon, eBay, and Jomashop. Every watch listed as “Certified Pre-Owned” on Amazon and Jomashop comes with a one-year limited warranty and a WatchFacts Report so you can rest assured that the timepiece delivered to your doorstep will meet all your expectations. Furthermore, pre-owned timepieces offered by Kay Jewelers, Jared, and Zales have all been inspected by WatchFacts.  With a WatchFacts report in hand, buying a pre-owned luxury watch is no longer a guessing game but now it’s a safe, secure, and transparent process.  "

It is building a sizeable database of paying customers from around the globe who all have a dedicated interest in collecting militaria. WARSTUFF also has a growing following via social media and its monthly e-newsletter.

Our water flows down the Italian Alps at 1600 metres above the sea level, from an oligo-mineral source known for its organoleptic properties.
