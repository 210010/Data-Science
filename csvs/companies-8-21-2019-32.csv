There are 3.4 million apps and games currently available on the Play Store store alone.

By using an app store, users see less than 1% of the games available to them, the majority of these from the large studios with bigger marketing budgets. Why Now: Another 1 billion people are expected to gain access to the internet in the next 3 years through mobile. Growing up truly mobile-first they’ll discover all their entertainment, including games via their phones.

GANTEC,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/gantec,"Agriculture, Biotechnology, Farming","Gantec was founded in 2005 with a goal of providing innovative, sustainable solutions for the agriculture market. The original insight for the technology came during a trip to Senegal in West Africa. The founders observed a Neem tree there, which grows green and healthy year-round in the desert. The question was asked of whether the properties of this tree could be transferred to other plants to improve their growth and health. Seven years and hundreds of trials later, the answer appears to be that yes, the properties of this amazing tree can be transferred to other applications, with resulting benefits in plant growth, vitality, and yield. This is the basis of Bio-Adaptive Supplementation, the core technology behind Gantec products."

We broadcast our tickets across a wide number of markets and vendors using the most advanced technology available to get the tickets available in as many places as possible.     We also have been proactively building software to help us better research and find tickets, such as building software that notifies us when venues release tickets to sold out events that we know are already profitable. Thus, having this kind of technology allows us to essentially guarantee a profit on a percentage of our purchases since they're for events that are proven money-makers. One of the biggest reasons we're actively looking for investment is to allow us to build even more software that notifies us of low ticket notifications, sales trends and much more!    Our business is easily scale-able with the technology and infrastructure that we've already built , but we just need more resources to get to a multi-million dollar revenue business on a much quicker timeframe. We were founding in November 2013 with an initial investment of only $2,000, so you can see the growth we've already shown. In a $4 Billion annual industry, there's a ton of room to grow and we're hoping to find the right partner to help us get to a million dollars in sales in 2015!"

Along with games, their writers like discovering and sharing the latest gadgets and technologies around gaming outside of PC and consoles. Game Mob‘s humble beginnings began in December 2012, from just an idea of creating a hub for strictly mobile gamers. As they saw this industry rapidly shift from casual games to comprehensive gaming experiences, they felt a need for a site that showcases that, the best qualities of gaming on a mobile device. So, they created Game Mob – Gaming + Mobile. It started out as a small blog and after a few iterations of the site here and there, they only recently launched the official site. They attend major events such as E3, GDC, and PAX. Also run quality promotions with companies such as Steel Series, Gameloft, and Indie Studios. They also are a go-to source for the latest mobile gaming news for other tech sites. There is a lot more to come. Join us, become part of the family, contribute. Everyone’s opinion’s matter as there are millions of mobile gamers across the globe from all walks of life."

T1's CEO anticipated this and created the largest array of top-quality online and mobile lottery/gambling games in the world. The NY Lottery recently picked T1's Bejeweled game (licensed from EA), out of 46 possible choices, to feature in its massive NYC MTA and TV ad campaign.  These are specialized games that have to pass muster with states and the three online platforms that host the games for 46 states and 120 countries.  T1 has created valuable IP - 4 patents issued & 10 more patents filed. T1 has LT contracts with the three leading online gaming distributors.  The contracts give them access to all 46 states and 120 countries. T1 has a huge amount of business already signed as part of multi-year contracts, creating clear revenue visibility, and a very substantial increase in revenues in the very near-term with financing.   Financing will go to game integration into platforms (about $20k per game), and further investment in mobile and online content (all games are created in-house in Stamford CT), including engineers and artists needed to expand production.   Orders are growing consistently.    The company's contracts call for IMMEDIATE porting of games to platforms (see Game Porting Schedule).  Revenues could reach well into the many $10s of millions in three years, and approximate $5 million in year one after funding.  See summary attached.

Galisto,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/galisto-gmbh,"Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Business Intelligence, Data Integration, Education, Information Technology, Internet, Knowledge Management, Software","Knowledge management is THE growing challenge for quite each company! The core IT-activities of a company and its people are quite the same:  They just want to create, store, refind, maintain and share information and knowledge. One of the biggest issues for companies today is to provide that goal over the large variety of applications and devices which are in use.  A lot of effort is needed to synchronize data between systems and to find information in all these systems.  Collaboration with external partners often results in additional time waste, because of the effort for the multiple administration of information in different data silos. The Galisto-Platform solves these challenges.  It interconnects existing applications and systems and improves this way the usability of the information.  The result is a significant time-saving to find and organize data.  External partners may be integrated in a private and secure way, e.g without exposing confidential information e.g. to email systems. What's the difference to systems like Sharepoint or Confluence? Galisto is able to adapt to the companies and users individual needs in a simple way. Galisto does not try to redefine the challenges until they fit to the system. Galisto sets the focus to the context of the information.  Users have to deal with changing context the whole daily business.  Supporting them in managing context leads to improved quality of their work and significant time savings. And yes: For most of the functions Galisto provides, there already other tools doing the same.  The USP of Galisto is the combination and integration of these functions in one platform.  Galisto allows to interconnect knowledge of different existing data-silos.  Users can do their work most of the time with one single user inteface (UI).  They have access to a lot of different data sources without the need to use all their different UIs. In most cases there is no or only small need to customize for the initial steps using the Galisto-Platform.  Galisto connects existing Data from existing sources and allows an improved usability.  There is a very low initial risk, because no customisation of existing data or datasources is needed. Galisto allows the long-lasting availability and usability of a companies relevant and possibly unstructured knowledge.  Organisational changes have less impact to knowledge-loss  For companies applying the Galisto-Platform, a lower TCO (total cost of ownership) is resulting, mainly causes by time-saving.  For the owner, a very interesting margin on invested capital is resulting.  https://www.galisto.ch - https://en.galisto.ch"
