Using imagery from various satellite constellations, weather data, and other datasets, the model accurately predicted yield six months prior to the end of the growing season. Realizing the potential for the technology applied to use cases around the globe, Descartes Labs turned its focus to developing a cloud-based supercomputing platform for the application of machine intelligence to massive data sets. This platform could be used by anyone to develop intelligent learning models to do science on data, and make that data actionable.  Capitalizing on the confluence of advances in AI and high-performance cloud computing – along with the rapid increase of sensors capturing information all over the globe – Descartes Labs has created an enterprise data refinery that enables organizations to model – and predict changes in – natural resources and the entire value chains in which they live. With an initial focus on satellite imagery, Descartes Labs processes a pipeline of data flows from all the major satellite constellations, at scale, to provide instant access to analysis-ready images of the entire world via a massive, searchable, on-demand interface. For example, petabytes of imagery can be searched and retrieved, and all features from various constellations accessed, in under 100 milliseconds.  By collecting, normalizing, and presenting science-ready data generated by satellites, the Descartes Labs Platform is advancing and accelerating unique applications of machine intelligence for consumers, corporations, and governments worldwide.

Deep Isolation,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/deep-isolation,"Clean Energy, Environmental Engineering, Impact Investing, Nuclear, Renewable Energy, Risk Management","Nuclear waste, in the form of spent nuclear fuel, has been accumulating at nuclear reactors since the dawn of the nuclear age. The United States has never had an operational disposal solution, but nuclear operators have paid 0.1 cents per kWH into the Nuclear Waste Fund, which is meant to eventually be used for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel. There is currently approximately $40 Billion in the Fund, but no active program to dispose of nuclear waste. Deep Isolation will be the first private disposal solution in the United States. Deep Isolation offers an innovative solution to safely and securely isolate and dispose of spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear reactors. Our horizontal drill hole technology offers a safe and low cost alternative to conventional disposal methods. Deep Isolation utilizes mature technology perfected by the US drilling industry over the last two decades. We can emplace spent nuclear fuel within a few years after site selection and licensing, while staying well within the budget of the current Nuclear Waste Fund. Nuclear waste, in its original fuel assemblies (requiring minimal handling) is placed in sealed canisters. These are lowered a mile deep down vertical drill holes lined with steel casing, and then inserted into horizontal storage portions that are several miles long. The waste is placed in sedimentary formations that have demonstrated geologic stability and impermeability by having contained volatile gases for tens of millions of years. Each drillhole can hold 30% to 50% of the lifetime waste from a gigawatt nuclear reactor. If desired, the waste is readily retrievable."

Dented Brick Distillery,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dented-brick-distillery,"Advertising, Distillery, Marketing, Retail, Wine And Spirits"," Company Stage:	$0-$500K trailing annual rev.  Est. Pre-Money Valuation:	$5,000,000 Previous capital raised:  $2,100,000 Amount of capital seeking:  $1,500,000 Monthly burn rate:	$50,000	Current year revenue:	$200,000 Number of employees:	5 - 10	Date company was founded:	March 2012 Dented Brick Distillery is an award winning, fully operational, and high capacity distilled spirits plant producing old world craft spirits. Dented Brick has utilized web based sales programming and big data analytics to achieve strategic wholesale partnerships and distribution in 11 states offering 7 products. Our go to market strategy is based on the concept of brand activation at the on-premise point of sale. We have developed a web based portal to deliver utilitarian brand items to accounts. Our sales team is offered monthly sales programs to incentivise them to sell our brand, and the portal allows the sales member to deliver branded items to an account during a sales call as an incentive to the account to purchase our items. On-premise brand activation lead to off-premise sales. Federal law requires suppliers of alcohol contract distributors to sell their product to retailers. This is an impediment to customers wanting Craft brands. Due to mass consolidation of distribution, craft suppliers have few options of distributors to choose from. Small brands with distribution use sale forces that sell the equivalent mega brand. Small brands do not have the budget to activate consumers in the traditional mega brand campaign. The market share of U.S. Craft spirits reached 3.0% in value in 2015, up from 1.1% in 2010. This places 97% of the market in the hands of very large corporations like Beam Suntory. These mega brand competitors utilize massive budgets and national agency advertising and events. In addition, craft suppliers have few options of distributors to choose from. Our proprietary web portal and on-premise brand activation strategy allows us to end run this barrier, and go direct to the millennial consumer. Distributors are receptive to marketing offered by all suppliers. DBD is developing a web based platform to assist distributors with brand activation at on-premise locations through direct delivery of point of sale branding merchandise, a low-cost method to compete with the more expensive traditional branding campaigns used by mega brands. This method will offer a sales channel to the craft buyer and eventual crossover to off premise sales. Utilizing our proprietary data compilation tool, DBD can identify trends in the market on a monthly basis. We will be able to target trends at a state by state or national level in categories and brands to steer our product development and marketing. Our proprietary DentedBrick.com web portal allows distribution sales personnel to design custom point of sale merchandise on-line on-site, directly activating consumers at the point of sale. DBD is a national wholesale distribution company, and has contracted with Aurora Wine and Spirits, a national wholesaler with contacts and knowledge needed to assist DBD gain distribution in all targeted markets. The DBD on-premise support program will drive customer retention. The company value will increase exponentially with repeat customers in a multi-state distribution environment. The U.S. distilled spirits market in 2017 equated to $78.07 bn in sales, with the largest sub-category of spirits is vodka at 34%, then whiskey at 24%, and rum at 12%. The spirits industry has experienced steady growth over the last ten years. The spirits segment volume has been growing at a CAGR of 2% over the last 10 years. Smaller brands have been gaining share. The non-top 5 brands gained between 12 and 37 % over a 20 year period and between 2 and 9% in the last 5 years. Craft products like Tito’s Vodka and Hendrick’s Gin have become attractive brands. Millennials are driving the shift to Craft, using their purchasing power to disrupt the market. Surveys show Millennials drink more different types of spirits (vodka, rum, tequila and whiskey) than other generations. Often, as is the case with gin, new infusions that may have been impossible to market in the past are quickly becoming millennial mainstays. Marc Christensen, Founder, is a regulated markets wholesale distribution specialist and a proven entrepreneur as illustrated with the ongoing success of OTW Safety and US Wine. Mike McSorley, Head Distiller, has more than 20 years industry experience and has been a distiller with 2 prior operations.

In independent lab tests it was shown to absorb and dissipate energy, reduce the speed of impact, and deflect glancing blows to significantly reduce sports injuries.  Unlike competitors’ products, DYH’s ProCap is available in custom colors, is decal-friendly and is both heat and cold resistant. The core technology was spawned at a firm funded by private investors, physicians, and Ben Franklin.  That company merged into Defend Your Head in 2013 where the product was advanced and an additional patent was acquired.  Market launch is scheduled for late summer. DYH is led by John Roman who spent 9 years in the NFL, was President of Merrill Lynch Trust Company, and founded Valley Forge Capital Advisors.

Giving them the best tools and the ability to be fully competitive, the power to keep growing event in a bad economy, and the freedom and flexibility they are hoping to achieve. Giving the companies the edge they are looking for to grow faster.  In order to survive and succeed in this world of accelerating change, modern marketing professionals need a new generation of marketing software to help them find more future customers; to build, sustain and grow relationships with those buyers over time; and to cope with the sheer pace and complexity of engaging with customers in real-time across the web. And in many companies, marketing must knit these digital interactions together with the efforts of their colleagues on the sales team.  Marketers need to interact seamlessly with their customers across all stages of the sales funnel, and they need data and analytic insights to understand where and how to allocate their budgets for maximum return. Our software must be easy to adopt and use. Visitors Lifecycle Management(VLM) software is fundamentally different from other kinds of business applications, like CRM, ERP and independent single point solution vendors. With those systems, the large companies typically configure them once, and then use them for months or even years with relatively little change. Marketing is much more dynamic – users need to constantly conceive, build and launch new marketing campaigns every few days or weeks, with minimum effort and no IT support. Our customers at Deskgod typically tell us that they spend one-half to one-third of the time as they did previously, which translates into much more time for them to invest in the creative aspects of their job. Our software must be powerful enough to solve real-world challenges. Modern marketing is challenging, to say the least. Marketers must control all aspects of visitors lifecycle management without of consistently switching between multiple applications like email marketing, analytics, help desk, live chat and more. Visitors are the lifeblood of the online businesses. Visitors must accurately guided to become customers, before being snatched up by competitors . And today’s marketer needs to be able to prove the results of their marketing investments, so sophisticated-yet-easy reporting and analytic tools are as important as campaign tools.  Deskgod was designed and built by real world marketing professionals who understand what marketers need to be successful. Still, Deskgod always balances powerful with easy, so that you can unleash the power when you need it, without having it in the way when you just need to get something simple done and out the door. Our software must be complete, for you and your customers. Your customers don’t care about what marketing software you use. But they will care if you use multiple disconnected systems that create a confusing user experience as they move from the web to email to live chat and beyond.  Deskgod Visitors Lifecycle Management(VLM) software spans the entire customer experience, across every stage of the sales funnel. Looking inward toward the marketing user, only  Deskgod combines completely integrated tools for managing the entire Lifecycle of website visitors, with powerful analytic tools to make sense of it all.

It will allow food delivery businesses to borrow and lend drivers from one another at short notice. In addition, GPS tracking will provide full visibility of all orders.  One member generates revenue from otherwise redundant resource while the other is able to keep their customer satisfied. Food delivery businesses can't always predict when there will be a surge in the number of orders received and as such struggle to meet customer expectations with timely deliveries. One of the key contributors to this is the limited access to delivery drivers. Further, the majority don't have access to an affordable solution to track their drivers which then makes the dispatch process inefficient. The Delivery Club technology platform is being designed to tackle both of these challenges, providing a holistic solution. With the comfort that they can access drivers when needed, we believe these businesses would be more inclined to increase their marketing spend and grow their businesses. Further, they would have the ability to earn money towards the cost of their delivery drivers when they would otherwise be idle. The GPS tracking would allow them to run a more efficient dispatch process and increase customer satisfaction levels. Overall, food delivery businesses should run more efficiently, ultimately improving their profitability. Delivery Club intends to disrupt the food delivery market."

Decision Point AI™ is the company that has an Augmented Intelligence Platform that facilitates Decisive Impact for Companies, Executives and Shareholders. It utilises Decision Science instead of Data Science to focus corporate efforts on critical and Augmented Outcomes to deliver Decisive Impact to its clients. Decision Point AI™ is vertical and horizontal Market agnostic and is focused on technology and consultancy services for any industry or organisation.

Decision Science Data driven decision making augmented intelligence #dddm_ai ""Decision Point AI™ augmented intelligence supports decision making when there is a lack of data to otherwise make decisions"" While the standard pathway for Decision Science is to focus on data as a tool to make decisions and solve business problems. Decision Point has further augmented the current thinking by adding collated data through an augmented intelligence platform and applying human interpretive algorithms that enable expert context to establish both true meaning and trajectory in a real time manner. Real time DDDM through Decision Point AI™ dddm_ai establishes a clear competitive advantage in a world where enterprises are told competitive advantage no longer exists DDDM_AI is fundamentally different from the slower data science route which is involved in finding insights by analysis and modelling from data, after this data has been collected, processed and structured by data engineer. While business who are ""driven most by data-based decision making had 4% higher productivity rates and 5-6% higher profits, a study of 179 large publicly traded firms"" by Brynjolfsson, Hitt and Kim of MIT Center for Digital Business found in 2011 based on Data Science. No impact analysis currently exist for the evolutionary real time DDDM_AI that utilises augmented intelligence but by extrapolation the expectation is for higher productivity, utilisation and profits for client companies. Subjective Logic Augmented Intelligence A fundamental aspect of the human condition is that nobody can ever determine with absolute certainty whether a proposition about the world is true or false. The human capacity to create theories or hunches can have profound impact on the direction and effectiveness of organisations, enterprise and countries. Decision Point utilises an Augmented Intelligence Platform built on subjective logic to refine and explicitly emphasise the factors and certainties that underwrite decision options. Additionally the Decision Point Augmented Intelligence Platform utilises human insights as part of its data queries to augment the processing power of the AI with context and meaning of that data through human knowledge and expertise. Subjective logic is a type of probabilistic logic that combines the capacity of probability theory to handle uncertainty with the capacity of deductive logic to exploit structure of formal argument. Subjective logic explicitly takes uncertainty and source data trust into account. Subjective logic is suitable for modelling and analysing situations involving uncertainty and relatively unreliable sources. Subjective logic can be used for modelling and analysing trust networks where a measurement of the degree to which one social actor (an individual or a group) trusts another social actor and Bayesian networks that represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Bayesian networks are ideal for taking an event that occurred and predicting the likelihood that any one of several possible known causes was the contributing factor. For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms."
