eFamily.com,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/efamily-com,"E-Commerce, Payments, Photo Sharing","While honeymooning in 2005, my wife and I came up with the idea for eFamily.com. We knew we wanted to start our own family and share those special moments with those closest to us, many of whom happened to be thousands of miles away. Also during that time, we were selling the first consumer web-based business that I co-founded (3GUpload.com), so it was the perfect moment to combine our love of family and business. Fast-forwarding to 2010 (after a few attempts to build our own solution), we had an opportunity to expand the eFamily service with the acquisition of Famiva.com. At that point, we were able to realize our original vision of family sites with photos, videos, status updates, shared calendar, family tree, and custom family domains. Our company grew, but – like nearly every online business – we started seeing strong demand for mobile versions of our service. And so in 2013, we decided to purchase the software assets from a company called Origami. We loved Origami’s software solution including the mobile applications – arguably the best in the marketplace. Our plan with the Origami software acquisition is to create an even more powerful eFamily service. We’ll take the lessons we’ve learned from our experience in the family space, and we’ll apply those to this powerful new platform moving forward. So in closing, a lot of people wonder why we’ve been diligently pursuing this business for over 8 years. It may seem illogical to most, but there is a deeper reason and motivation than just business success and financial rewards. We truly believe a site like eFamily.com can change the world for the better. When we look back on our lives, we will be able to say that we helped families stay connected and celebrate life – no matter the distance.  eFamily.com believe that at the root of positive change in society is a group of healthy families, and part of staying healthy as a family is communication and celebrating life. As a result of our efforts, we hope to help this world become a better place. Will you join us?"

EFRAG is a private association established in conformity with Belgian law and whose members known collectively as “EFRAG Member Organisations” are European stakeholders and National organisations having knowledge and interest in the development of IFRS and how they contribute to the efficiency of capital markets.  EFRAG’s role as advisor to the European Commission is formalised in a Working Arrangement which states that “EFRAG will provide advice to the European Commission on all issues relating to the application of IFRS in the EU. In close consultation with the European Commission, EFRAG will participate in the early phases of debate on all issues related to the standard-setting process”. As a result, EFRAG’s activities are aimed at ensuring that European views on the development of financial reporting standards are properly and clearly articulated in the international standard-setting process, so that ultimately IFRS can be endorsed in Europe to the satisfaction of all European stakeholders. Following the implementation of the “Maystadt” reform in 2014, EFRAG’s activities include assessments of whether the IFRS proposals/requirements are conducive to the European public good. This includes the interaction with economic concerns such as financial stability and growth.  EFRAG is achieving its mission both through its participation in the IASB consultation process and its proactive work, and, under the leadership of the European Commission, its interaction with the Accounting Regulatory Committee, to hear about the potential economic or political concerns from Member States’ representatives. Upon request, EFRAG also provides the European Commission with technical expertise and advice on whether newly published IFRS meet the criteria for endorsement in the European Union, in conformity with the 1606-2002 “IAS Regulation”.  EFRAG Member Organisations provide for the primary funding of EFRAG. Additional substantial funding is secured from the European Commission under yearly grant agreements. However, the EFRAG contents and publications are the sole responsibility of EFRAG and can under no circumstances be regarded as reflecting the views of the European Union."
