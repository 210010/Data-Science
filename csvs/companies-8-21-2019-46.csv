UBICUO,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ubicuo,"Apps, Mapping Services, Security","Ubicuo was born as a platform to detect risks on the streets, with an NGO, whose founder lost her child because a trash bin in the streets was electrified. So, citizens use the application to register risks and the NGO to deliver it to the people in charge of the solution. After that we asked ourselves ""What happens in organizations?"" And we saw a huge opportunity because there are many accidents in the work environment.  Here in Chile, there were more than 170,000 (one hundred seventy thousand) accidents in organizations last year. Moreover, we saw that the risk detection processes are manual (using paper), which results in decentralized information, useless for decision making. That is why we opened our platform for the organizations. so they can use our mobile application to search and register risks in their buildings using images and georeferentiation. Then, at the office, they can complete those registries, create reports and send them to the people in charge of the solution. But that is not enough, we are continually innovating; adding new features every month like guidelines to avoid the human errors or automatically risk detection through video cameras. So, why Ubicuo? Because we reduce four times the time needed to detect and solve risks and that, is translated as less workIng accIdents;… and also we centralize the information and provide statistics. How to acquire Ubicuo? It’s easy, by subscribing to one of our packages or asking for a quotation. Currently we have four paying clients, three hundred users, one hundred inspectors and more than five thousand risks detected.  We have to say thanks to StartUp Chile, because since the beginning of the program we have been duplicated our billing, we got a pilot in Santiago and we are closing a deal to get private investment.  Finally, the team. We have complementary profiles, specialists in different software areas and project management. but we have one thing in common: we love challenges.

All the funds go to a trust fund (known as a UFund) for the athletes, which they can access at the end of their NCAA eligibility. Fans have the opportunity to participate for free by using the UBooster Points they receive at signup. These points directly correlate with the athletes’ Heat Index. To keep raising an athlete’s Heat Index, fans can Boost a player while simultaneously contributing money to their UFund, which also helps their favorite athlete’s Heat Index score climb. Additionally, when fans Boost an athlete they can select which school they support and each athlete’s profile will display the leading Boosters. For example, if a fan of School U boosts Joe Football for $10, Joe Football will receive 100 UBooster Points towards his Heat Index and his profile will display School U as the leading fan-driven institution. On National Letter of Intent (“Signing”) Day, the opportunity to Boost an athlete closes. All the funds donated to these athletes will be held in escrow until his or her NCAA eligibility expires.

UberSpat,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/uberspat,Search Engine,"UberSpat is an online debating site that allows users to input a debate of their choosing.  What separates UberSpat from its competitors is that UberSpat is focused on the evidence.  By focusing on the evidence, UberSpat becomes a research tool as well as a debating site.  For example is the debate topic is ""Man causes global warming"", users can add evidence to support and to oppose this debate.  The evidence can then be rated by other users.  All of this information then becomes extremely beneficial to people that want to know more about both sides of the debate.  They can simply read all of the best articles from either side.  That's what makes this an amazing site.  It becomes something of a cross between Digg, Wiki, and Google.  It's also a lot of fun, so give it a try. http://www.uberspat.com http://youtube.com/watch?v=iVK6vaWinjU"
