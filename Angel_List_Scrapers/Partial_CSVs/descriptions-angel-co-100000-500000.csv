Our goal is to highlight the information that's most relevant to a candidate being a ""good fit"" independent of race, gender, (dis)ability, military history or sexual orientation.How it works: candidates simply login (Facebook or LinkedIn), we pull in the relevant data and show them jobs with company profiles. On the flip side, companies post job advertisements and view candidates that are a good fit, but no name and no photo. Both candidate and recruiter simply pass/like each option. Whenever there's a match between candidate and recruiter, each receive a push notification where they can then message one another to setup a phone screening, interview, formal application, etc."

Bodegas cannot buy more than 7 days of inventory, suppliers cannot distribute directly to all of them (they are 25x supermarkets) and these stores cannot access normal sources of working capital. Currently, suppliers are selling to warehouses. Bodega owners go weekly to buy limited quantities of stock.

267,Higher Admission,https://angel.co/company/higher-admission,A marketplace where colleges bid on students,"Tradition, regulation and romanticization of the college admissions ritual have obscured that the current process is simply a highly inefficient way to buy and sell higher education; the life-shaping cost of education demands a market place solution.Using our SaaS, colleges set up as many dynamic, granular, variable and fixed pricing profiles as they wish. For example, a high school senior with a 3.5 GPA, 1,400 combined SAT math and reading scores who is first gen college and an Eagle Scout could be offered a $10k scholarship. We put that offer on the mobile devices of every student in the U.S. who has entered a profile on our App and matches the stipulated qualifications. If the student is interested in pursuing the offer, they click to lock in the price, receive the college's messaging, links and social media profile. If the student locks the price, the college receives the student's contact information and begins the recruiting process."

274,mLakshmi,https://angel.co/company/mlakshmi,Mobile credit for low-income customers,Individual merchants and shops serving those living on less than $2 USD a day in developing regions almost always extend credit to their regular customers – residents of about 100 - 200 households living locally. Our idea is to make credit available in this financial ecosystem - via a service called mLakshmi – rewarding merchants for extending mLakshmi’s credit to customers as well as tracking customer’s credit history and making higher credit lines available to customers with good repayment histories. There is zero new investment and usage cost for the merchant. The hypothesis of our proposal is that merchants will adopt and promote mobile money services since the service offered both reduces the merchant’s credit risk and also increases revenue from the transaction fee. Viral adoption is achieved by customers signed up on mLakshmi going to a merchant that isn’t signed up and urging him to sign up since they are used to the convenience of the credit mLakshmi offers.

THE SOLUTION

If an agent doesn’t know someone in the client’s destination, their only option is to hunt for an agent, a time-consuming process with inconsistent results, since there is no reliable way to judge the quality of the agent.Once agents are connected, they are left to manually manage their referrals with spreadsheets or emails.
